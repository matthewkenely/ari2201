in a 2015 strategy document on detention regulations Maltese detention centres have time and time again been reported to offer substandard living conditions likely to amount to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to the European Convention of Human Rights In a report from human rights organisation Aditus for AIDA the asylum information database NGOs remain unable to provide proper information on the state of the living quarters after losing access in 2020 and being only allowed to visit detainees in a boardroom on the margin of the Safi Detention Centre The detention centres are managed by the Detention Service DS a government body which falls under the Ministry for Home Affairs DS staff receive some in-service training however people recruited for the post of DS officer or seconded from the Security Services are not required to have particular skills or competencies In 2020 a delegation from the UN Human Rights Office visited Malta to find migrants living in severely overcrowded conditions with little access to daylight clean water and sanitation The High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2021 underlined the failure of the government “ to ensure safe disembarkation and adequate reception of migrants with rescued migrants being stranded aboard vessels that are unsuited for their accommodation held in inadequate reception conditions upon disembarkation including being at risk of arbitrary immigration detention and facing obstacles to access immediate assistance such as medical care ” In 2021 the Committee for the Prevention of Torture another UN monitoring body reported a catastrophic situation saying Malta ’ s immigration system simply “ contained ” migrants who had essentially been forgotten “ within poor conditions of detention and regimes which verged on institutional mass neglect by the authorities ” In January 2022 the Maltese government provided the Council of Europe ’ s committee of minister – responsible for the execution of judgements from the European Court of Human Rights – with updates on the judgement Feilazoo v Malta claiming that 86 of Safi Detention Centre detainees were living in refurbished or brand new compounds that it had increased outdoor activities to three hours of outdoor space and improved communication with families outside It further reported professional football coaches giving weekly football sessions and capoeira classes for female detainees Launching the Migrant Health Service in 2021 the government said it had reduced 80 of referrals to the health centres and Mater Dei AE and introduced a Close Monitoring Unit to provide separate accommodation for high-risk persons and a Welfare Officer But in reply the CoE ’ s Committee of Ministers requested “ more detailed and extensive information ” on whether these measures were sufficient to remedy the inadequate conditions of detention highlight by the CPT visit in 2020 In July 2022 Aditus Foundation released a series of testimonies from detainees who had been held for 18 to 25 months in both China House and Safi between December 2019 and April 2022 The testimonies confirmed the living conditions had not improved sufficiently since the CPT ’ s visit Further testimonies confirmed that the situation had not improved sufficiently “ One of the applicants claims he was detained in complete isolation for 147 days in a container in the so-called CMU unit due to being diagnosed with tuberculosis ” Aditus reported in its AIDA report “ Accordingly NGOs report that detention conditions are still substandard with little improvement since the CPT ’ s visit beyond the overcrowding linked to the decrease in arrivals and the increase in pushbacks ” Aditus reports that “ Maltese detention centres still offer substandard and undignified living conditions in poorly maintained buildings designed in a carceral setting characterized by the following conditions ” Additionally NGOs reported that there is no dedicated space for minors in China House one zone being dedicated to them in the Safi Detention Centre offering the same living conditions as the other blocks Healthcare The creation of the Migrants Health Service in 2021 and a new clinic operating in Safi Detention Centre saw some positive improvements in the provision of health care to asylum seekers and migrants And while asylum seekers in 2022 appeared to be systematically screened upon arrival and referred to the appropriate services Aditus cautions that this must be read within the context of a substantial drop in arrivals with little to no pressure on the system NGOs reported that some applicants reported that their treatment was stopped for no apparent reason and resumed following their intervention Numerous applicants suffering from serious conditions reported that they are just given paracetamol when they complain of their conditions “ That said the Migrant Health Service appears to be aware of the medical condition of the detainees and usually refers them to the mainstream healthcare system albeit with substantial waiting times The issue therefore lies in the follow-up and the level of care afforded to applicants in between the medical appointments which is reported to be insufficient by NGOs Applicants with a potential serious condition must generally wait several months before being seen by a specialist and a diagnosis on their condition is reached Meanwhile their detention may have a detrimental impact on their health ” Aditus said The screening of mental health problems remains an issue with many detainees falling through gaps until they attempt suicide and are referred to Mount Carmel Hospital MCH In 2020 93 detainees were taken to the psychiatric hospital 60 in 2019 and 17 in 2018 in order to be treated for self-harm or suicide attempts Excessive force Aditus says the use of excessive force and other questionable forms of punishment remains an issue especially where protests or escapes are attempted In January 2020 detainees started a protest which led to the intervention of the police - 19 were arrested Days later 22 were convicted to a nine-month prison sentence for “ taking part in a rioting mob ” NGOs exposed the way migrants were brought to Court tied together in pairs and displayed to the general public contrary to standard practice – an example of inhumane treatment and prejudicial to the principle of presumption of innocence Minors were among the accused and should therefore have been awarded specific protections throughout criminal proceedings Several migrants tried to escape the detention centres In September 2020 five migrants tried to escape Safi during a riot A private security guard shot at one of the migrants who sustained light injuries even though guards are not allowed to carry firearms in closed centres 27 other detainees were accused of causing damages In the CPT report the Committee reported having received several allegations of excessive use of force by DS staff and private security staff following riots According to migrants reporting to the CPT staff purposely shook the fence while some detainees were climbing it causing them to fall to the ground where they were subjected to baton blows The CPT also reported the unwarranted use of pepper spray by custodial staff against detained migrants The magisterial inquiry into the death of a young migrant who fell from the three-storey high fence in an attempted 5am escape from Lyster Detention Centre in September 2020 remains open Although he received assistance by nurses on site he was only transferred to hospital hours later where he was certified dead at 11am The CPT investigated the case saying it “ can not reassure itself that staff including health-care staff had reacted sufficiently promptly when crucial help was needed to attempt to save this young man ’ s life from the effects of suspected internal bleeding over a period of at least three hours ” Incarceration of asylum seekers Serious shortcomings in detention centres evidenced by human rights groups like Aditus Source AIDA report April 2023 Detention Services Agency refutes claims Refurbishment works in all compounds and residential blocks operated by the Detention Services Agency will be completed by the end of this year the agency said in its reaction to the AIDA report Works started in 2020 included the installation of new vandal proof utilities additional and brand-new sanitary facilities new apertures in all living quarters and a comprehensive CCTV system in all areas The agency is insisting that a lot of work has been done since 2020 to address the issues flagged Two new accommodation blocks and a clinic were built which helped eliminate overcrowding and enabled the management to house migrants according to protection needs a spokesperson for DSA said “ These changes also made it possible for the detainees to use the outdoor facilities for the whole day except night-time ” he added China House The organisation also refuted claims that the building known as China House which is being used as a reception centre for newly arrived migrants is structurally unsound The claim was made in the AIDA report and another compiled by the national watchdog that monitors conditions that detainees are kept in “ The building never had any structural problems and constant maintenance works are carried out usually after the migrants using it are either transferred to open centres or to the detention centre in Safi ” the DSA said It added “ The Hal Far Immigration Reception Centre China House was renovated in the year 2020 and was initially being used as a designated COVID-19 quarantine facility for irregular migrants ” The Malta Red Cross was engaged three years ago to run the medical operation of this compound and remains engaged till today The building is now used to accommodate migrants for a temporary period normally in the days following their arrival in Malta The DSA also refuted claims on the lack of communication facilities adding that a new television and telephone system was introduced in the past years “ All new arrivals are given access to the phone on the same day they arrive at the centre and those who do not manage to do so are assisted to use applications such as WhatsApp and IMO ” the agency said It added that new meeting facilities were built and additional space for such visits will be provided in the next few days These new facilities will be equipped with an open phone line system for lawyers NGO representatives interpreters family members and other visitors Moreover a new female compound will be opened in the coming days the agency said Healthcare The DSA said the medical clinic at the Safi Detention Centre is of the same standards as every other health centre in Malta “ It involves round the clock presence of nurses daily GP clinic quasi-daily psychiatric clinic GU clinic dermatology clinic and other services… All complaints are triaged by nurses and doctors who are aware of all minor or major cases ” the agency said It insisted that medications are given based on an inpatient-style treatment chart and filed in the person ’ s health records Nurses are allowed to triage the need for basic analgesia if needed or upon a patient ’ s request It also refuted claims that treatment is sometimes stopped suddenly “ All treatments are given using a treatment chart and any lapse must be justified When detainees are transferred from one compound to another the nursing team are required to provide a medical handover which is documented The same procedure is applied when a detainee is released from the closed facilities and provided with a Medical Handover Sheet with extra supplies of medication for the upcoming days ” Increased security The DSA said security at detention centres has been beefed up to ensure more accountability among officers and reduce vandalism A surveillance system is also installed in the vans which transport detainees to different areas it noted The agency refuted suggestions that migrants were not provided with adequate clothing for the winter “ Winter clothes such as thermal underwear track suits thermal socks and blankets are constantly being made available to everyone The claim by the author of the AIDA report that such clothing is not being provided is also false ” It also clarified that all people admitted to detention are provided with the necessary documentation in a language they understand The agency said training is provided on a continuous basis in accordance with a schedule and provided to all new and veteran staff It said that in the past year detention officers were trained in basic life support and use of emergency defibrillators The agency said

Schembri unless he gave up VGH,17/05/2023 18:33,Updated at 720pm with more details of Tumuluri 's claims Ram Tumuluri the one-time director of Vitals Global Healthcare is claiming he was threatened by Keith Schembri unless he sold the hospitals concession to Steward Health Care In a fresh instalment on Wednesday evening Times of Malta reports that Tumuluri is seeking whistleblower protection in the US to reveal alleged coercion threats and corrupt practices by Joseph Muscat ’ s government in the hospitals contract The newspaper reports that in a 500-page filing in the US Tumuluri alleges he was the victim of a plot by Muscat ’ s government to boot him out of Malta in favour of a pre-ordained deal with American operators Steward Health Care In one of the more damning statements Tumuluri claims that during a December 2017 meeting Schembri told him “ You know what happened with Daphne and you don ’ t want to end up in that position You want us to be a friend not a foe ” Schembri denied the claims insisting they are completely false and baseless The new story follows earlier revelations that showed how former prime minister Joseph Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously called VGH Europe for consultancy work Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in an October 2017 car bombing outside her Bidnija house Three men who carried out the bombing are serving prison sentences while the alleged mastermind Yorgen Fenech is awaiting trial Court proceedings against the alleged bomb suppliers are also ongoing The latest development was described as “ surreal and shocking ” by Opposition leader Bernard Grech in parliament accusing the government of being in a slumber You are in cahoots with criminals Grech said The PN is holding a protest in Valletta this evening READ ALSO Joseph Muscat ‘ I don ’ t fear arrest… this is a frame-up ’ Ernst Schembri Muscat and Mizzi The hospitals concession was transferred to Steward Health Care in February 2018 with the American company buying Vitals ’ shares However Tumuluri is claiming he only agreed to the deal because of “ unlawful coercion ” and “ extortionate acts ” by Steward and Muscat ’ s government Tumuluri wants to turn whistleblower under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC The law is a powerful and effective transnational anti-corruption law targeting bribery of foreign government officials by US companies or individuals Tumuluri 's FCPA filings were obtained by OCCRP and shared with Times of Malta and The Shift News Tumuluri blames VGH ’ s failure to fulfil its contractual obligations on the company ’ s then CEO Armin Ernst Ernst had stepped down from VGH only to turn up as CEO of Steward Health Care that eventually stepped in to take over the Malta hospitals concession In comments to the newspaper Steward dismissed Tumuluri 's claims as “ malicious self-serving and entirely without merit ” “ This so-called filing is self-evidently a stunt either for publicity or monetary gain it is not real or legally cognisable and is in and of itself a farce ” a Steward spokesperson is reported to have said Tumuluri refers to meetings he is alleged to have had with Keith Schembri in which the former OPM chief of staff made several “ unlawful demands ” The former VGH director also claimed he was threatened that unless he complied with the request to sell his shares to a “ third party ” which later transpired to be Steward he would be removed from the country Tumuluri continues to claim that Schembri was acting on the behest of Joseph Muscat In another meeting Tumuluri claims that Schembri threatened him with “ fabricating ” false criminal charges against him and arresting him if he turned up at Vitals ’ annual Christmas party Fearne as ‘ relevant individual ’ He also claims being pressured by Konrad Mizzi to give up the concession and indicates Chris Fearne as a “ relevant individual ” The filings say that Fearne had been in discussions with Ernst regarding plans to take over the concession since approximately September 2017 Fearne denied this when contacted by the newspaper In his testimony to the National Audit Office Fearne indicated that a September 2017 meeting in New York was the first time the government and Steward talked about a potential takeover But Fearne told the NAO that the New York meeting was between Muscat Schembri and Ernst Tumuluri also claims that in one of his first meetings with Fearne after he was appointed health minister Fearne demanded that the VGH director show loyalty to him rather than Schembri and Mizzi In its third report on the hospitals deal released this week the NAO commented on the unorthodox arrangement at the time whereby the contractual aspects between government and Steward continued being handled by Konrad Mizzi despite not being health minister Fearne testified that decisions were being taken behind his back The NAO report accused Mizzi of misleading Cabinet on the implications of a side agreement signed with Steward in August 2019 by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if the contract was annulled by the courts,['Valletta'],"[(1724, 1732, 'LOC')]"

Vitals-Steward deal,16/05/2023 19:01,The Nationalist Party will bring out supporters and demonstrators outside the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening to protest the government ’ s record on the mishandling of the Vitals-Steward hospitals privatisation deal Opposition leader Bernard Grech said it was calling on the public to show its condemnation of the Labour administration in the face of the third NAO report on the privatisation deal The Opposition filibustered its way into the parliamentary debate of Tuesday which had been reserved for the budgetary subvention to the Housing Authority with a sustained attack on the Steward-Vitals hospitals privatisation deal Bolstered by a damning Auditor General ’ s report that sealed a treble on the condemnation of the Muscat administration ’ s deal to transfer three State hospitals to a private consortium the PN led the attack with MPs Karol Aquilina Darren Carabott and leader Bernard Grech “ When the House was discussing the court ’ s rescission of the deal I said without hesitation that Labour were the fraudsters in this case today I can they are the biggest of all fraudsters as the NAO report confirms without any doubt that this fraud was committed by Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela in full complicity of Labour MPs who supported what is the biggest scandal in our country ’ s history ” Aquilina listed various black marks from the NAO report such as waivers granted to Steward early in 2020 overpaying the concessionaires by €49 million in 2020 when Steward made a profit of €6 million according in 2021 another €25 million over and above their budgetary allocation and that the NAO found that between 2016-2021 the government paid Steward €268 million which were not salaries “ What does this mean It means that from 2016 onwards government paid them over €410 million under Muscat they received €128m which does not include wages paid separately by the government and another €280 million not wages under the Abela administration “ So those who are to blame for this scandal are Muscat and Abela political responsibility must be carried and justice be done ” MP Darren Carabott accused the government and Labour MPs of having been deliberately inactive before the accusations constantly lobbied at the Vitals-Steward deal “ In 2016 the UHM asked for an investigation in the PAC in 2018 the Opposition wrote to the NAO in 2020 Adrian Delia filed his case and Labour did nothing when the NAO reports were published you did nothing Carabott lampooned former minister Konrad Mizzi who stewarded the privatisation deal as “ the man who claimed to have found God but always made sure to put his money before faith ” condemning his refusal to testify before the NAO “ Robert Abela can not blame these sins on his predecessors because his administration approved every budgetary subvention to Steward year after year The real victim here is the Maltese work who earns his money not feeds at the trough “ The government can still salvage the situation yet Abela is compromised by his personal oath to Muscat Government MPs have the choice to show loyalty and good faith to the court decision and the NAO report by joining the Opposition ” On his part Bernard Grech accused the Labour bench of supporting “ corrupt contracts ” – save for former MPs Marlene and Godfrey Farrugia – and described the court rescission of the deal as a rare occasion that served as a damning indictment of the government and its questionable deals He accused Muscat and Abela of using both internal and external influence to obstruct justice by preventing the court verdict from being enforced “ They went to great lengths to use public funds to prevent the Court from reaching the intended verdict ” he said accusing the government of hypocrisy in first mocking any evidence to substantiate allegations on the Steward deal and now enthusiastically chasing the concessionaires out “ They were caught out and now they are saying ‘ it ’ s not me ’ ” For the government side justice minister Jonathan Attard deputy PM Chris Fearne and whip Andy Ellul propped up the administration ’ s defence Attard said the government had obtained a win at the arbitration tribunal against Steward and had immediately countered the appeal filed by Steward in the Maltese courts apart from having taking over hospital operations He said the Opposition should not prejudice government ’ s legal position but respect its strong legal argument “ We will fight those who try to tarnish our country ’ s reputation it is a total spin that the NAO report quantifies some ‘ fraud ’ as being ‘ bigger ’ this is not stated anywhere in the report ” Deputy PM and health minister Chris Fearne also put up a strong show to defend his role and that of the Cabinet as being kept in the dark by the actions of Konrad Mizzi in negotiating the €100 million default for Steward “ I may have been kept in the dark in the past on this deal but now it is my ministry that is leading the salvage operation on this ” Fearne said the government had taken immediate action in the wake of the court decision on the rescission of the deal and also defended the immediate steps taken in 2020 to start steering discussions towards rebalancing the concession as well as for any termination of the deal “ That was the first time that I personally and the prime minister learnt of the €100 million court default and it got us stuck in the mud because we could not terminate the deal Thanks in part to the case filed by Adrian Delia from 5 April the hospitals started being State-run ” Additional reporting by Marianna Calleja,"['Attard', 'Attard']","[(4004, 4010, 'LOC'), (4096, 4102, 'LOC')]"

the Health Services Delivery Agreement - regulated the delivery of services as outlined in the concession However it was not possible for the NAO to establish whether progress was registered in terms of level and quality of service following the concession of the hospitals The NAO also raised question marks on the manner by which the transfer of control was handled by Malta Industrial Parks Ltd that considered the transfer between VGH and Steward as an intra-group transfer and thus not liable to the payment of a laudemium “ This Office NAO deemed the treatment of this transfer by MIP Ltd as an intra-group transfer as incongruent with the fact that the ultimate beneficial owner had changed and therefore the payment of a laudemium to the government was warranted Nevertheless this charge was not raised by the government ” the NAO said Furthermore when control of the concession shifted from SHC International LLC to SHC Systems LLC INDIS Malta Ltd previously MIP Ltd was not notified of the transfer despite the change in ownership “ The NAO contends that this too did not qualify as an intra-group transfer and therefore a laudemium could be charged However the deed did not specify any consequence for failure to obtain consent for the transfer of the sites yet indicated that the non-payment of a laudemium would result in the nullity of the transfer ” the NAO said What did the concession cost public coffers Between 2016 and 2021 the government paid the Concessionaire €268600000 with €52700000 paid to the VGH and €214900000 to the SHC Salaries of resources made available to the Concessionaire by the Government during this period accounted for a further disbursement of €188500000 The total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the Hospitals between June 2016 and end 2021 was €456 million READ ALSO NAO report slams Konrad Mizzi ’ s failure to cooperate during hospitals concession audit Request for urgent discussion In an unorthodox twist during Monday 's parliamentary session government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament suspend its agenda and hold an urgent debate on the voluminous report published by the NAO He also proposed an hour 's suspension to give members the chance to leaf through the abridged version of the report which has more than 100 pages the full report has more than 400 pages and no time limit on the debate The Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO 's findings Ellul did not commit the government to holding the urgent debate tomorrow Since no agreement was reached this evening's session continued as usual,['Valletta'],"[(2604, 2612, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/122619/the_garden_of_forgiveness_healing_the_trauma_of_the_interdett,The garden of forgiveness: healing the trauma of the Interdett,04/05/2023 06:30,The bust of Nerik Mizzi the short-lived Nationalist prime minister who died in office three months from election in 1950 faces the St John ’ s Cathedral in Valletta – 250 metres off Castille Square where the statue of his successor George Borg Olivier stands proudly over a 10-foot pillar Fitting for the ‘ father of Maltese Independence ’ Unlike Mizzi exiled in 1942 without trial by the British forces to Uganda along with other suspected Italophile luminaries from the PN Manwel Dimech – the socialist intellectual the Maltese Catholic archdiocese deemed dangerous – enjoys pride of place in Castille Square Not a politician but exiled by Malta ’ s colonial governor over false accusations of being a German spy and having suffered excommunication from the Church he would die in an Egyptian prison after seven miserable years spent incarcerated And while Dimech earned rightful recognition under the Mintoff administration in 1976 with a statue by Anton Agius the jury is out on why Labour has failed to honour the victims of the ‘ Interdett ’ - that other historic shunning of 1961 which is much closer to home the party and even its living members 62 years after the notorious interdiction of the Labour executive a pitched war between Church and Labour that effectively made voting Labour a “ sin ” during two election rounds won by the PN no monument to the excommunicated victims yet exists The enduring exemplar of what the Interdett meant is Guże Ellul Mercer the former deputy prime minister whose death in 1962 consigned him to burial in an unconsecrated grave on the margins of the Addolorata cemetery – a ‘ punishment ’ that was part of the interdiction package administered by Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi in his war against Dom Mintoff It was an old weapon used by the Church that mimicked the colonial forces ’ power of exile in 1910 it excommunicated Dimech for two years in 1930 it announced a vote for Strickland ’ s Constitutional Party and Labour was a “ mortal sin ” and in 1960 it interdicted the young socialists Lorry Sant and Joe Camilleri for insulting the Church in a party pamphlet “ It is time for a goodwill gesture ” says Jason Micallef former Labour secretary-general 2003-9 and now chairman of the Valletta Cultural Agency who has a bone to pick with the Curia From the roof garden of the VCA ’ s Valletta Design Cluster a community space that replaced the old abattoir he can lay his eyes on the walled gardens of the Archbishop ’ s Palace right opposite it “ It should be open to the public ” Micallef says who is gently laying claim on it by proposing that it can be run and managed by the VCA itself “ It is one of the few urban gardens available in Valletta and it is not being used ” This Micallef thinks is suitable reparation for the Interdett The archbishop disagrees His Valletta palace houses the ecclesiastical tribunals that hears marital annulment proceedings Such a private forum can not abut on a public garden In 2020 Micallef roped in former arts minister Jose Herrera to petition Charles Scicluna for the garden to host a public monument to the victims of the interdiction The archbishop suggested that the government sticks to an earlier suggestion for a monument erected on the Floriana Mall “ It certainly won ’ t be the Church to dictate where the State gets to erect a public monument ” Micallef hits back “ You can ’ t wash this wound away with the apology of 1978 or the blessing of the graves in 2021 This is no reconciliation for a nine-year martyrdom ” he says Psychological warfare The clerical activism of the late 1950s and 1960s in Malta was fuelled by a junta of Catholic organisations il-Ġunta which had heeded the call from the Maltese archbishop to prevent Labour from “ relegating the church to the sacristy ” The short-lived Mintoff administration had resigned in April 1958 after mass dismissals at the naval dockyard Two years earlier the 1956 referendum for total integration with the UK had floundered due to mass abstention from the Nationalist Party and the Church ’ s opposition Now Mintoff had changed gear and joined the mainstream call for full independence from Great Britain At the height of the Red Scare Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi was fixated that Mintoff a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and member of the Fabian Society was communism ’ s wolf in sheep ’ s clothing Gonzi considered Mintoff an enemy who would drain his church of its earthly powers whether by class conflict or central economic planning or by his avowed plan to seek international assistance for Malta ’ s independence from either West or East This veiled threat of godless communism was the last straw for Gonzi in April 1961 he interdicted the Labour executive declared voting Labour the sale of or reading of socialist newspapers and attendance at Labour meetings mortal sins The Ġunta exhorted the Catholic faithful to see the forthcoming 1962 elections as a crusade against ‘ Mintoffian devils ’ forging a path for the Nationalist Party to win the election What was particularly damning in the 1961-1969 interdiction a resolution finally came in a six-point ‘ peace treaty ’ between Mintoff and Archbishop delegate Emanuele Gerada is that even though it was the Labour executive that was interdicted it had a scatter-gun effect on ordinary people seen reading socialist newspapers and attending Labour meetings “ The tangible results of Gonzi ’ s war were very immediate Families were torn apart Labour activists were ostracised from social organisations Children of Labour activists and known sympathisers were bullied at school and in the villages Priests wielded more power and Labour youths ’ chances of finding jobs decreased even further exacerbating their already miserable economic situation This was the bleak backdrop of Independence in the 1960s as much as 60000 men and women had left the islands in search for work – back then comprising as much as 20 of the population ” writes historian Mark Camilleri in a piece for this newspaper back in 2021 “ And here lies a very important reason why going to hell was much worse than it sounds today For the oppressed and hard-working Catholic-Labourite mired in a dire economic scenario who struggled to make ends meet the Catholic religion could provide some hope and light at the end of the tunnel – death at least promised a good afterlife Now all the hard work and lifetime devotion to Church and God mattered no longer as the Labourite was bound for damnation anyway In other words Gonzi took away from the most vulnerable the most important religious element of Christianity the resilient and spiritual hope that they could one day be saved Gonzi sent these people to hell ” Fr Anton d ’ Amato the present director of the archbishop ’ s migrants commission and son of former Nationalist MP Helen D ’ Amato would probably agree He researched the Interdiction for his theology licentiate in 2019 and today supports the creation of a truth-and-reconciliation committed “ to understand what happened and start healing and reconciling wounds ” “ It is like an intergenerational trauma ” he told 103FM presenter Andrew Azzopardi “ It is still being passed on from one generation to the next despite the passing of decades the greatest hurt the one that is inherited is the internal division created in each person ” D ’ Amato says a divide made worse by the fact that devout Catholics were denied the grace of the sacraments History time and space Micallef ’ s desire to see the Interdett monument inside an excised property of the Church would add a flavour of reparative justice But Malta already struggles with imagination on the locations of monuments – and location does matter here – because the island has not yet dealt with so many “ alien ” memorials which no longer have a place in modern-day Malta Historian Charles Xuereb argues in his book Decolonising The Maltese Mind – In Search Of Identity that Malta needs to analyse its monumental landscape especially in Valletta and its environs where British monuments outnumber all others quite the anomaly in a Maltese capital “ There are several monuments to British personnel who lost their lives abroad with no connection with the Island ’ s history These alien memorials are blocking deserved native ones Valletta still misses a monument to its prime patriot Mikiel Anton Vassalli while it unashamedly boasts of a mausoleum for the British commissioner Alexander Ball who exiled him ” And it is not only the omission of an Interdett monument that riles Xuereb His list of missed monuments needs a serious discussion and proper policy not just some accommodating solution to a quick-fix recollection of the Mintoff years “ I can not help but agree with the suggestion to erect a monument to those politicians who in 1961 – practically forgotten even on the 50th anniversary of the event in 2021 – suffered at the hands of an outdated Catholic Church in Malta under the Gonzi bishopric stubbornly resisting late local secularisation Such a monument should also include the 1930s victims of the Strickland party also interdicted “ Recent omitted monuments include one to the 43 illegally banished Maltese to Uganda during WWII In this case to further rub salt in the wound of omission in St Julian ’ s there is a plaque hailing the notorious Col Bertram Ede who between 1930 and 1942 was secretly managing a network of prominent Maltese spies for the British government ” Reconciliation But how Jason Micallef understands that it is disappointing that his own Labour government has not yet named even a single street for the victims of the Interdett there are at least five streets named after Ellul Mercer But rather than taking it to his own party Micallef feels it is the Church that must respond in kind “ For an institution that has often lofty words about the state of the environment donating an urban garden to the public can be a tangible gift of goodwill to recognise the damage of the Interdett ” Micallef says He refuses the tag of it being an opportunist claim for his VCA “ I have no problem in saying that we would support its maintenance ” he says And has not the Maltese Church paid its dues with the 1991 concordat for its lands “ No ” Micallef says “ The Church paid its dues with the government then financing its teachers ’ salaries in its schools ” In the Church document on ecclesial renewal ‘ One Church One Journey ’ Archbishop Charles Scicluna lists specific processes the Archdiocese has committed itself to implement in these next four years Page 67 carries the section ‘ Wounds in our personal and collective memory ’ “ Unless one comes to a peaceful resolution with one ’ s suffering the effects of unresolved trauma can become contagious passed on in families and tightly knit communities whose memories become distorted through unresolved grief This does not mean forgetting past events it means re-examining them with a new attitude ” There is no mention of the Interdict The uncaptioned photo underneath is that of Archbishop Scicluna blessing the grave of Guze Ellul Mercer in 2019 “ In Malta the wounds of clericalism have taken on distinct forms that are particularly harmful because of our proximity to one another our turbulent political history these past hundred years It is paramount that we acknowledge our frailties that we name how we have inflicted wounds on each other in the past and as Christians seek to engage in a long process of mutual listening seeking reparation and ultimately praying for the power of the Spirit to be able to forgive one another ” Micallef thinks the Maltese Church ’ s apologies and blessings will never be enough to heal a historical wound such as the Interdett “ With all due respect the Church must say ‘ sorry ’ with a deed ” Micallef says his eyes on the prize across the road from St Christopher Street,"['Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Floriana', 'Valletta', 'Valletta']","[(156, 164, 'LOC'), (2229, 2237, 'LOC'), (2328, 2336, 'LOC'), (2685, 2693, 'LOC'), (2812,

it ’ s true Is this what it all means ” Grech said But the PN leader called bluff on the Commissioner ’ s statement “ We know that the order for this young person ’ s arrest for hanging a banner came from the police depot ” Grech also said that he was happy to see the banner still hung outside Parliament at the Labour Party ’ s workers ’ day event Repeated PBS attacks The Nationalist Party ’ s protest organised under the slogan 'Nagħtu s-Saħħa lill-Ħaddiem ' Power to Workers was held near St Luke ’ s Hospital in Pietà and right opposite PBS offices Grech said the choice of location on Monday was no accident He said that they chose to set the protest in front of ‘ a monument to fraud ’ referring to St Luke ’ s and ‘ Labour ’ s most powerful propaganda machine ’ a reference to PBS Grech criticised PBS repeatedly throughout the protest speculating that it will not report on the Nationalist Party ’ s workers ’ day events He said that PBS is the media station of the Labour Party and is being led by someone “ close to Robert Abela ” “ This is a person with a particular brief to make sure that the news in our country is written in a way that is almost fairy-tale ” “ This is why we have to continue meeting in the streets in village squares We must continue talking We have a duty to be the voice of the people ” Hospitals corruption Turning to the hospitals privatisation deal Grech said that the Labour government sold three public hospitals to foreign thieves “ opening the door wide open to them and showing them exactly how they can steal from us ” He acknowledged a nearby banner that reads “ Thank you Adrian Delia ” It was Delia who fronted proceedings against the government in court to declare the Vitals Global Healthcare privatisation deal fraudulent He won the case last February after the judge presiding over the case anulled all agreements forming part of the deal Grech thanked Delia but also said that people should thank the Nationalist Party for winning back the hospitals as well He said that ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat together with former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi knew that the Vitals investors were thieves “ No wonder they Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi opened trusts in New Zealand and companies in Panama Anyone who dared open their mouth was called a traitor ” Grech said it was Prime Minister Robert Abela who as legal counsel to Cabinet at the time gave his blessing so that the three hospitals can be resold to Steward Healthcare instead of being returned to government after Vitals exited the concession “ They did everything to try and make people forget about this And he did this with the complicity of PBS which everyday tries to bury the Nationalist Party ’ s news and tries to paint a positive picture of everything ” Grech scapegoats foreign workers for low wages Grech touched on cost of living noting that inflation is at its highest level seen in 42 years “ How can we not be angry Cost of living is going up and it ’ s continuing to go up reaching 7 ” He also hit out against the Labour Party ’ s tax refund cheques after Abela announced that a new round of cheques will be issued next week While Maltese people deal with inflation Grech said Abela continues to bring hundreds of foreign workers “ Whenever the Maltese worker tries to fight for a higher wage they find a foreign worker ready to work the same job for practically nothing This is unacceptable ” “ It ’ s unacceptable to lose our soul for greed and money I want a just country You want a just country ” Grech said the government needs to embark on a new immigration policy where the skills of foreign workers especially in new sectors are transferred to local workers so that their conditions can increase “ Our vision is the upskilling and reskilling of workers ” he said Labour ashamed of full EU membership Grech says Traditionally May 1 has been an opportunity for the Nationalist Party to celebrate Malta ’ s accession into the EU a process it had spearheaded Grech said that everyone is here to celebrate the worker but that the party is also here to celebrate Malta ’ s accession to the EU “ Others want to make us forget about our joining the EU It was the dream of the Nationalist Party the dream of Eddie Fenech Adami ” he said as the crowd cheered Grech noted how the Labour Party did not make any mention of the EU anniversary during their workers ’ day event “ This is the Labour Party Not only did they not want us to be full members but they are ashamed of celebrating our full membership in the EU That ’ s why we must celebrate ”,"['Valletta', 'Pietà', 'Pietà']","[(157, 165, 'LOC'), (269, 274, 'LOC'), (1071, 1076, 'LOC')]"
https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/122633/labour_lines_up_singers_for_workers_day_meeting_under_the_shadow_of_growing_apathy_planning,[WATCH] Robert Abela pledges reform of planning process at Workers’ Day mass meeting in Valletta,01/05/2023 11:30,Robert Abela has hinted at reforms in the planning process that will prevent construction to start if the permit is still being contested The Labour Party leader told supporters at a mass meeting in Valletta to commemorate Workers ’ Day the time had come for “ major reforms ” in the environmental sector He then asked “ Does it make sense if it ever made sense that planning law allows construction work to start when the permit is still being contested in front of the tribunal or the law courts ” The Prime Minister said the time had come to discuss reforms in the planning sector but held back from clearly stating what should happen “ While not allowing for abuse and sabotage we must start discussing reforms that do justice with everyone not least ordinary citizens ” He also identified affordable housing as a problem where the country has to make the “ next big step ” “ The next step is to ensure that government takes initiatives to build a strong stock of apartments at affordable prices to target those who want to become home owners but can not irrespective of the many initiatives we have already taken ” the Prime Minister said Workers ’ Day was celebrated under the shadow of growing unease within the party in the aftermath of the Steward Hospitals court ruling Rosianne Cutajar ’ s resignation and disquiet in Gzira and Xagħra where the PL has faced sharp criticism over its environmental record from its two mayors Conrad Borg Manche and Christian Zammit respectively Zammit resigned from mayor and the PL ’ s Gozo regional committee last week and attempts by Abela to lure him back appear to have failed He accused the two major parties including his own of prostituting themselves to big business Abela ’ s reference to reforms in the planning process were in part overtures to the two mayors The party suffered major setbacks in the polls last month with the administration having to deal with growing apathy among supporters This year ’ s mass meeting was held in Freedom Square outside parliament In previous years the celebration was held in the much larger Castille Square Supporters thronged the square and its approach roads wearing red and white t-shirts The meeting kicked off with a concert that saw various singers including Mary Spiteri Mike Spiteri Petra and DJ Ryan Spiteri entertain the crowd Abela kicks off his relatively short speech by saluting workers and the party ’ s labour heritage Using the old phrase ‘ workers ’ party ’ to describe the PL Abela insisted the party was the only workers ’ movement in Malta A nod to trade union activism In a nod to trade union activism Abela recalled the incident in 1999 when General Workers ’ Union officials were charged in court for obstructing a police bus that was escorting scores of arrested striking workers The Prime Minister recalled his father George Abela who back then was the GWU ’ s legal counsel coming home worried that the union officials faced lengthy prison sentences He then saluted former GWU secretary general Toni Zarb ’ s memory and applauded the trade unionists who persisted in their defence of striking workers and eventually won “ That is the same courage we have to show today ” Abela said adding it was important not to forget what it meant when the PN was in government He said the party was proud to have translated the trust people showed it into concrete measures that supported families He then listed free childcare pension increases the wage supplement civil rights for all the cheapest energy bills in the Eurozone and the lowest unemployment rate ever Income tax refunds next week He said that the annual income tax refunds will start being paid out in a week ’ s time at higher rates announced in the budget The outlay for this year will reach €26 million more than double what was refunded in recent years The tax refund was a 2017 electoral pledge and the PL government has maintained it every year since then “ We keep our word ” Abela said He then took a pot shot at the Nationalist Party who he said will criticise the refund “ They can cringe all they want because in the next budget we will give more because we are agents for the good of workers… we still have more to do ” he said “ It is true that a government ’ s job is to look after its people but this can only be guaranteed by a Labour government ” He said a public consultation on how to transform a car park in Bormla that was taken back from the American University of Malta will be transformed into an open space of leisure for residents will start on Thursday Later this month he added details will be given on 15 urban greening projects proposed by local councils and which will be carried out by Project Green for a total expense of €10 million Abela said new jobs will continue being created and the economy will continue to grow He insisted the government still had four more years “ We will not be perfect in everything and this is why we have to continue learning from you ” he said He urged people not to be discouraged promising four more years of “ hard work and results ” to support workers young people pensioners and families “ You know where you stand with us We deliver what we promise ” he said before closing off with a string of catch phrases that included Dom Mintoff ’ s famous “ Malta first and foremost ”,"['Valletta', 'Xagħra']","[(199, 207, 'LOC'), (1339, 1345, 'LOC')]"

reports before it the Missin found grounds to believe that the European Union and its member States directly or indirectly provided monetary technical and logistical support to the Libyan Coast Guard LCG and Department for Combating Illegal Immigration DCIM that was used in the context of interception and detention of migrants ” The report accuses the EU and its member states of supplying Libyan authorities with rubber boats for coastal patrolling as well as SUVs buses ambulances and radio-satellite communication devices In the case of the 108 migrants intercepted while en route to Malta according to the witness interviewed by the mission the men and women were taken back to the disembarkation point in Tripoli They were met with a group of security forces whose faces were covered and the migrants were boarded onto buses Items such as passports and rings were taken away from them “ A witness mentioned that a captain approached the migrants and offered to release those that could pay 100 to 200 United States dollars a deal that the witness said was not even honoured for those who did pay ” Malta is one EU member state that has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Libya to increase capacity-building and coordination support to Libyan entities involved in migrant interception The MoU signed in 2020 saw Malta finance migration coordination centres in Tripoli and Valletta manned by six people in total Under the agreement Malta was to propose to the European Commission and member states to increase financial support for the Libyan Government of the National Accord GNA to help secure the country ’ s borders and provide the necessary technologies for border control and protection Malta was also expected to fund additional maritime assets required to intercept and follow up on human trafficking activities in the Mediterranean basin ’ s SAR zone The MoU is set to expire this year The UN report gives a detailed description of what Libyan Coast Guard LCG interception and disembarkation operations look like Migrants who spoke with the UN mission recalled how LCG ships would make seemingly deliberate unsafe manoeuvres that would lead to boat capsizes or would cause migrants to fall into the water and drown “ The Mission also found reasonable grounds to believe that personnel on LCG ships shot at or near boats carrying migrants causing migrants to jump into the water seeking temporary safety Migrants were often physically and verbally assaulted and threatened by LCG personnel and other security officials during their transfer onto LCG ships and forced return to Libya ” Malta is not the only EU country to have offered support to Libya ’ s interception efforts In 2017 Italy signed an MoU with Libya agreeing to help the Libyan Coast Guard and enhance its maritime surveillance capacity while providing financial and technical support It was renewed in November 2022 without amendments Over and above the Brookings Institute says the EU has offered support to the Libyan Coast Guard and other government agencies to the tune of 455 million since 2015 Last February the European Commission handed over five specialised search and rescue vessels to the Libyan Coast Guard This project was initiated by the European Commission and implemented by the Ministry of Interior of Italy The European Commission insisted that such projects aim to avoid the loss of life as migrants cross the Mediterranean by tackling human trafficking at source But as resources go to interception Libyan entities still commmit violations and abuses against migrants The UN report describes a revolving door by which migrants are captured released recaptured manage to escape and end up being intercepted again “ Typically migrants made their way out of places of detention following the payment of ransom a successful escape or en masse discharge only to be captured again by the same actor that had detained them or another group ” “ An overwhelming number of interviewed migrants described to the Mission that they had attempted to escape detention and cross into Europe several times some five to ten times over Persons migrating to Europe were loaded at times against their will onto varied kinds of boats Some of the boats were barely seaworthy and overloaded by smugglers and traffickers ultimately resulting in their sinking at sea and a loss of life ” Conditions in Libyan detention centres were no better than conditions at sea Migrants told the mission that there were few mattresses and sleeping accommodations at the centres They were overcrowded toilets were never cleaned and quarters had to be shared with detainees with infectious diseases There was also reasonable proof of sexual slavery and forced labour in certain detention centres A child from Guinea told the Mission “ Women are sexual objects there Some women are used as prostitutes but are not paid They are like slaves ” The girl had been sodomised after being sent to do domestic work for a man outside the building where the migrants were being kept Women men boys and girls were also forced to work in factories A child from Mali described being taken to a farm and made to work with animals When he confronted the man at the farm on why he could not leave he found out that he had been bought by him,['Valletta'],"[(2568, 2576, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/122498/campus_hub_audit_serious_doubts_on_tender_process_fairness,Campus Hub audit: ‘Serious doubts’ on tender process fairness,25/04/2023 06:40,An audit of the University of Malta ’ s tender award for the development of a campus hub to Vassallo Builders has raised “ serious doubts ” on fairness in the process The National Audit Office said the university should have entrusted the 2015 tendering process to the Department of Contracts The report was tabled in parliament last week The award of the concession was made through a Request for Proposals RFP issued by the UOM then led by former rector Juanito Camilleri The RFP attracted only one bid from Campus Residence Malta Ltd a subsidiary of Vassallo Builders But “ multiple changes ” to original plans made after the concession was awarded including the incorporation of the medical school in one of the blocks and an increase in commercial space “ raise serious doubts about fair competition ” The NAO also lamented the absence of consultation at the initial stage of the project noting that this led to the criticism of various aspects of the project by students and academics Department of Contracts would have done it better The concession for the campus hub consisting of student residences and various amenities including retail a food court and an underground car park over a floor area of 80709sqm was awarded to Vassallo Builders Group Ltd for 60 years in return for an annual ground rent through a Public Private Partnership PPP venture According to the NAO the tendering process complied with the legislative framework regulating public procurement and the project largely made economic and financial sense especially in view of the fact that the university was precluded by budgetary constraints from auto financing the project But the decision to issue an RFP meant that the University of Malta had “ forfeited the opportunity of benefitting from the expertise of the Department of Contracts ” According to the NAO the Department of Contract ’ s expertise would have contributed towards more safeguards for and stakeholders ’ interests as would have broadened the competitive element surrounding this concession possibly attracting international interest in the project “ Moreover through this approach publication of the RfP was mainly limited to local sources thus not ensuring widespread exposure overseas ” the report states During the audit the university insisted that its former Director of Procurement had discussed this project with the Department of Contracts which had referred them to the government ’ s privatisation unit MIMCOL for assistance However when further queried by the NAO the university was not able to support this statement with the appropriate documentation and audit trail of such discussions On its part the Department of Contracts insisted “ that it was neither involved nor granted its approval for the UOM to receive competitive bids relating to this concession ” Moreover the Contracts Department denied referring the University to MIMCOL for assistance The NAO identified several short comings in the RFP including the absence of a right of appeal clause a standard clause which “ should always be included in a tendering document ” This clause safeguards bidders ’ interests and ensures that a fair tendering process is carried out Neither did the RFP specify the minimum ground rent to be paid by potential bidders to the university which was only established when the deed was signed in 2019 The deed sets out the yearly ground rent at €150000 annually for the first three years and increases through an “ escalation ” formula in subsequent years Moreover no provision was made for clawback provisions through which the University would benefit from a share of the profits generated throughout the entire lifetime of the concession Instead the university had opted for “ a secure income stream rather that profit sharing ” in a way that if the project registered a loss it would still have an income stream However the NAO contends that securing a secure income stream and securing a share in profits “ are not mutually exclusive ” Lost consultation report The report also laments no formal public consultation and broad discussion with major stakeholders prior to the issue of the Request for Proposals which eventually led to student protests related to car park fees The report refers to the criticism made by students and academics on various aspects of the project The report attributes this to the fact that “ stakeholders were not kept fully abreast of major developments and the project ” and to the absence of an Environmental Impact Assessment that triggers an automatic public consultation process The report also reveals that a detailed project financial evaluation was only carried out as part of the tender evaluation process rather than at the project inception stage The university argued that at the preliminary stage of this project it sought consultancy services with respect to the project ’ s viability of the proposed approach Nonetheless by the time of drafting its report the NAO had not received from the UOM the ensuing consultancy report stating that it was lost during the transfer of the Malta University Holdings Company MUHC offices from Lija to Campus Hub The medical school quandary The auditor also refers to the lack of consultations with the Mater Dei Hospital MDH especially since the land earmarked for the project had planning restrictions limiting its use to education and health The insufficient consultation and coordination with the hospital had a significant effect on the completion of the project due to a dispute with government over the relocation of the medical school to the campus hub This is because the development permit allocates one of the blocks in the campus hub for the construction of the medical school According to the NAO this implies that the university allowed for a contract variation that went outside the scope of the RfP for a university residence and community complex Through such a contract variation the university “ has encroached on the principle of fair competition as at RFP stage bidders were not aware that six levels in one of the blocks could cater for the medical school ” This also implies that potential bidders were not able to anticipate the possibility of generating revenue through the leasing of space within the Campus Hub to accommodate the medical school This situation arose because “ neither government nor university have issued a separate call for bids to relocate the medical school ” This quandary meant that the medical school remained incomplete by the end of 2022 when the NAO report was finalised The car park quandary The UOM had requested potential bidders to submit a financial option for the lease of underground car parking spaces to cater for the university ’ s needs The Vassallo Group offered to allocate 140 parking slots at the lease rate of €1060 per slot per annum increasing annually by the rate of inflation But the contract signed in May 2019 did not include any such provisos The lease of such parking spaces was to be negotiated and concluded directly between the successful bidder and the Ministry for Education But no such agreement was ever reached The Auditor General concluded that this situation could have been averted through proper planning during the competitive bidding stage Juanito Camilleri Projects Malta suggested RFP tendering process Speaking to MaltaToday former rector Juanito Camilleri insisted that his role in the project ended in June 2016 after his term as rector ended just after the preliminary agreement with Vassallo Builders was signed This means that subsequent changes which according to auditor departed from the original RFP happened at a later stage He explained that in 2013 faced with the imminent expiry of the lease on the university residence in Lija the university under his tenure had bought land which previously housed the Calamatta Garden Centre to house the new residential quarters The land was bought with government funding following a deal in which the university relinquished its rights on the medical school located in St Luke ’ s hospital granted to it by the British colonial authorities Camilleri strongly denied that the request for proposal was issued in the absence of consultation pointing out that the university council which includes all stakeholders including student academic representatives and government representatives including the permanent secretary was constantly involved in the process “ I assure you that the rector can not take any major decisions of such a financial magnitude without the prior approval of the University council ” Camilleri said He also insisted that the Education Ministry was also constantly kept abreast both before and after the change in government in 2013 Moreover it was the Education Ministry which had instructed the university to seek advice from Projects Malta the government entity responsible for private public partnerships It was Projects Malta which advised the university to issue a request for proposals Camilleri added In its report the NAO did not refer to any role played by Projects Malta but stated that the university had claimed that it had sought the advice of the government ’ s privatisation unit Mimcol which in turn denied any involvement Camilleri had no issue with the advice that was given to the university by Projects Malta insisting that it made sense to issue such a call since they were looking for an operator who had to create an innovative economic model to recover the substantial investment made over a number of years only to have it returned to the university when the 60-year lease expires “ I would have preferred to have more bidders and not just one as that would have given us a wider choice but everyone could apply for the RFP and I can not understand why the auditor is saying that international bidders were excluded as anyone could see the RPF ” While pointing out that he had no further role in the project after his term as rector expired he is sure that the subsequent changes “ would have surely followed an economic logic ” adding he had full trust in his successor Alfred Vella who is also accountable to the university council He also said that his vision for the project was that of turning the university into a living hub on a 24 hour and 365 days basis While admitting that some of the commercial development “ does not reflect what he had in mind ” and that he would have liked to see a book shop and university pubs which could also be a venue for student gigs overall the project is in line with the original vision,"['Lija', 'Lija']","[(5132, 5136, 'LOC'), (7768, 7772, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/122373/bring_the_crime_scene_into_the_court,[WATCH] Bring the crime scene into the court,21/04/2023 07:00,“ Take the scene of the crime home with you ” – this will be the new evolution in the Maltese justice system as a budding new technology inside the University of Malta ’ s Faculty of Media and Knowledge Sciences gets ready to enter the mainstream Inside the MaKS Immersion Labs criminologist Prof Saviour Formosa is showing me a bird ’ s eye view of Floriana that I can see through a headset for me to hover above by simply taking a few steps inside this laboratory In another contained space known as the SIntegraM CAVE where overhead projectors beam 3D scanned models of places such as Victoria ’ s Citadel or Għar Dalam researchers at the Immersion Lab can walk through these places without taking a single step turning corners peeking behind boulders or suddenly floating above the space they are in Prof Formosa familiar to the general public as the compiler of annual crime statistics and the author of various studies on Maltese crime patterns hopes the work being done at the University of Malta can bring ‘ eXtended Reality ’ XR – a term encompassing augmented reality virtual reality and mixed reality – into a myriad of spatial and planning applications from planning to tourism restoration to healthcare as well as the criminal justice system A case in point he mentions is using scanned areas of Malta ’ s geography to recreate or rebuild or even being able to reimagine what land and surfaces looked like before they were demolished or suffered a collapse Examples abound – a recent example is the collapse of the Bighi peninsula boundary wall beneath what is now Heritage Malta ’ s headquarters or even the Azure Window in Gozo “ We can scan entire zones and feed it to our computers where all the photographs of a particular area can be used to generate into a detailed 3-D mesh ” he explains as he hands me a joystick and a virtual reality headset I am suddenly plunged into the underground tunnels of Valletta where I can roam from one room to the other and into the great vaulted chambers beneath the capital city fully immersed into a different reality Working with the EU-funded SIntegraM equipment within the University ’ s Faculty of Media and Knowledge Sciences the research team – which comprises researchers Tram Nguyen and Fabrizio Calì – has scanned underground structures old buildings cliff faces and a good portion of Malta ’ s surface in the latter case allowing users to have an entire village reproduced before their eyes in their headset in the form of a bird ’ s eye view Other responsibilities involve assisting other students and departments with varied XR research projects as well as a facial reconstruction project with the 3D scanned skull of Maria Adeodata Pisani a beatified nun But Prof Formosa believes the technology has great potential to be applied within criminal investigations and the courts by capturing the crime scenes in 3D after a crime and also allowing for comparisons of these scenes with archived 3D scans from prior to the criminal event Particularly useful in sites severely damaged by explosions or similar destructive crimes “ We can use this technology to take the actual scene of the crime inside a courtroom literally the jurors defence prosecution and the judge or magistrate can ‘ walk ’ around the scene of the crime and see it from all possible angles ” Prof Formosa says He adds that before the admission of guilt by the Degiorgio brothers in the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia the scanned car bomb scene was to be part of the evidence being shown inside the very courtroom trying the Degiorgios Prof Formosa says the technology is especially necessary to be able to create comparative imagery of the scene of the crime before it gets disturbed by the various personnel that inspects it “ We are even able to analyse the projectional direction of bullets from blood splatter traces ” The spatial dynamics of a scene may also be better understood in a 3D virtual experience rather than from photographs or other traditional forensic documentation methods Scanning is done through a combination of photogrammetry – taking multiple photos and then stitching them together – and LIDAR which uses lasers to plot thousands of points which are then used to capture a scene in 3D That data is then processed on high-end computers and converted into 3D scenes before it is published to AR technologies such as Magic Leap or Virtual Reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift or Meta Quest XR technologies are also set to play a fundamental role in the metaverse where the next evolution of the Internet will converge real digital and virtual worlds into new realities accessed with VR headsets or a pair of AR smart glasses “ Essentially what requires a screen today could be redundant in a couple of decades ” says PhD researcher Fabrizio Calì “ Today there are contact lenses being developed that can act as screens you are receiving a call answering an email you won ’ t need access to a computer because everything will be popping up before your eyes The virtual and real will become interchangeable based on whatever you need to be doing ” Prof Formosa hopes to take the technology further within the next months – he thinks medical technology can be a net beneficiary of this type of scanning that allows surgeons unprecedented access to the human body or even allow the surgeon in one part of the world to use XR with a robot in another part of the world to carry out the surgery Another use could be tourism and heritage where people can see the Azure Window in its past glory to relive once more the majesty of the structure before its fateful collapse And then there are disabled users who are unable to access certain areas or structures but who can through XR be able to access these areas virtually “ Its usage could be manifold ” Prof Formosa says,"['Floriana', 'Valletta']","[(350, 358, 'LOC'), (1919, 1927, 'LOC')]"

thronged Valletta 's Republic street to denounce corruption in a protest called by the Nationalist Party and supported by the Union Ħaddiema Magħqudin This was the second protest called by the PN in the wake of a court ruling that annulled the Steward hospitals contract over fraudulent behaviour The first protest was held at the end of an urgent parliamentary debate last Monday Opposition leader Bernard Grech pledged Prime Minister Robert Abela his support if government files a lawsuit against Steward Healthcare to recover the millions in public funds spent on the deal However he also warned that if Abela failed to do so the Opposition would return to the streets to protest “ Only you have the authority to launch the lawsuit to recover our money File it and you 'll find us all united behind you ” Grech said directly addressing Abela by name “ But if you do nothing you will find us on the streets in front of you ” The crowd booed when Grech listed everyone in former prime minister Joseph Muscat 's team who was responsible for the hospitals deal The PN leader then went on to question the whereabouts and the work of Police Commissioner Angelo Gafa and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg “ If it was you who perpetrated a crime they would have hauled you to court Yet these individuals defend and protect each other because they have made a deal together ” Grech told the crowd adding that political responsibility should be shouldered Responding to an earlier pledge made by the Prime Minister to build a new hospital in Gozo in this legislature Grech recalled how the same promise was made multiple times in the previous 10 years He said Abela can not be believed when he makes such a pledge today The protest was also addressed by UĦM Voice of the Workers CEO Josef Vella who emphasised that regaining control of the hospitals did not release Steward employees He explained that although they perform the same work as others in the public sector Steward employees have inferior working conditions which violates the concept of equal pay for work of equal value “ This type of discrimination should have never been tolerated ” Vella said He said the UĦM had an ongoing court case against the government over its failure to honour a written agreement in which it promised to transfer Steward employees to the public sector under the same terms as their colleagues PN MP Adrian Delia the person who filed the court case to rescind the hospitals contract also addressed the crowd insisting that it was not enough that the hospitals are returned to the State He said political responsibility should be shouldered and action taken to recover the money spent on the concession Delia began his address with thousands shouting his name as he insisted a united Malta had triumphed He urged those present not to boo or humiliate PL voters who he said are equally unhappy deceived and betrayed “ Thousands of Labourites are outraged because this was the greatest betrayal in history ” Delia said and urged people to speak up in “ one voice ” for justice truth and righteousness While the crowd yelled in unison Delia reminded them that there is a more powerful weapon against the government 's intimidation hope Thousands of people had gathered in Castille Square and made their way down to the law courts People carried various protest messages denouncing the 'theft ' of public funds as a result of the hospitals deal One of the placards slammed the impunity of people close to the Labour government while another called for justice with JeanPaul Sofia the 20-year-old victim of a building collapse In his speech Grech reiterated that the PN would be filing a parliamentary motion to have a public inquiry into Sofia ’ s tragic death something the Prime Minister has dismissed Protestors marched behind a banner that read You Deserve Better Holding the banner alongside Grech and Delia was UHM CEO Josef Vella Two other unions the Malta Union of Nurses and the Medical Association of Malta could not attend because their statute precludes them from participating in protests organised by political parties but both have expressed criticism towards the hospitals concession deal and welcomed the court judgment Earlier on Sunday when speaking on NET TV Grech said Robert Abela had no respect for people “ He has no values and he is definitely not interested in you ” Grech said that it was the Labour government that negotiated the “ corrupt and fraudulent ” contracts for the concession of the three state hospitals to VitalsSteward and that it was Prime Minister Robert Abela and his friends that kept defending the deal The concession of St Luke ’ s Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and the Gozo General Hospital was struck down by Mr Justice Francesco Depasquale on 24 February Rescinding the contract and all side agreements the judge said he had no doubt that Steward had fraudulently tried to “ turn in its favour a situation resulting from the fraudulent actions of its predecessors with the aim of unjustifiably enriching itself on the backs of the Government of Malta and the citizens of Malta and Gozo ”,['Valletta'],"[(20, 28,

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/121124/parents_who_gambled_away_charity_donations_why_was_it_money_laundering,Parents who gambled away charity donations: why was it money laundering?,08/02/2023 07:40,A couple from Mosta handed a hefty €50000 fine for gambling away charity donations meant for their son ’ s cancer treatment were accused of money laundering in court Now on probation and also obliged to return the €35000 in charity they received the Debattista couple were charged in a case described in court as an act of “ self-laundering ” – meaning the laundering of one ’ s proceeds without hiding the criminal origin of the cash A financial crime expert told MaltaToday that the mere possession and use of funds or assets obtained though an offence – in this case a charity donation that was not used for its intended purpose – can result in money laundering so long as the person knows or suspects that those funds or assets were generated through the commission of a criminal offence In this case once the charity donations received by the couple were diverted towards gambling at that point a crime had taken place because they money was effectively ‘ stolen ’ from its intended purpose The money now had become a criminal gain and by putting it into circulation to be gambled any net gains from say a legal betting transaction would have ‘ cleaned ’ the cash making it ‘ good ’ In the case of the Debattista couple the fraudulent gains made through their first gambling wins and then subsequently lost meant there had been no net gain from the money laundering But the crime of laundering the cash – stealing the charity received to use in gambling – was upheld In Malta money laundering is any act or attempt to conceal or disguise the proceeds of a predicate offence It also includes ownership control disposition or movement of such proceeds with the intent to evade the legal consequences of the predicate offence or to assist any person involved in the offence to evade those legal consequences Predicate offences include a wide range of criminal activities drug trafficking fraud corruption extortion racketeering tax evasion and many others “ A formalistic approach could result in anyone committing a criminal offence also facing money laundering charges – the criminal is usually the one who comes into immediate possession of any funds or assets generated from an illegal activity and he is likely to be the main person to make use of them ” the expert said However in other cases beyond the mere possession of illicit gains or cash money laundering in other cases includes putting those gains into circulation – for example exchanging the cash from the proceeds of drug trafficking for a property or a luxury vehicle – to ‘ clean ’ the money and conceal its unlawful origin High-level laundering cases In recent years the Maltese police have instituted legal proceedings in cases of high-level money laundering including against former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri and Pilatus Bank Keith Schembri the once-powerful chief of staff to former prime minister Joseph Muscat was charged with corruption and money laundering back in 2021 The charges stem from allegations made by former PN leader Simon Busuttil based on information in the hands of the late journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia that Schembri had transferred €650000 through various offshore companies that were paid out to third parties in the form of financial instruments Here the predicate offence was the corruption of Allied Newspapers and Progress Press where profits were made to the detriment of Progress Press Through his companies Schembri is alleged to have channelled parts of those profits to former Allied employees Adrian Hillman and Vincent Buhagiar in the form of a gift or personal gain Hillman and Buhagiar were themselves accused of defrauding the same company they held directorships in The criminal origin of the profits was hidden by moving the money through a series of transactions – ‘ layering ’ As a police inspector testified in court “ what should have been a relatively simple transaction became a convoluted series of transactions intended to hide commissions coordinated by the same people who were involved in the deal ” Months later Pilatus Bank was charged with money laundering The private bank was shuttered in November 2018 when the European Central Bank revoked its license The bank had been thrown into the spotlight during the 2017 general election when Caruana Galizia alleged that the former prime minister ’ s wife Michelle Muscat owned the Panama company Egrant which had an account at Pilatus But a magisterial inquiry into the allegations found no such account attested to Egrant or Michelle Muscat and dismissed the claims Yet the bank was eventually hit with a €5 million penalty from the FIAU after the money laundering watchdog found serious and systemic failures in the bank ’ s due diligence And Pilatus owner Ali Sadr Hasheminejad was arrested in the United States on charges of sanctions-busting later dropped in a rare expungement by the US District Attorney The arrest however prompted the ECB to withdraw the bank ’ s licence But in Malta the police suspect the bank was being used for money laundering and that Pilatus failed to flag politically-exposed persons and document their source of wealth and funds What about ‘ pettier ’ crimes In lesser caes of money laundering a Sliema grocer was charged with money laundering in 2017 for using his store to cash people ’ s cheques which is illegal Almost moonlighting as a banker the grocer cashed cheques from third parties charging a minor commission which went in to his day ’ s takings and would then cash the cheques himself Since this is a service offered only by banks the man was accused of offering banking services and providing services relating to finance without the necessary licenses And by concealing the origin of the illegal gains this would be a case of money laundering Another couple who ran a butcher ’ s shop were also charged with money laundering because they allowed customers to pay with social benefit cheques They too were charged of operating an unlicensed financial institution and money laundering And similarly a couple who ran a confectionery were also charged with the same crimes for cashing clients ’ cheques,"['Mosta', 'Sliema']","[(14, 19, 'LOC'), (5217, 5223, 'LOC')]"

Egyptian national who benefited from asylum in Malta has been belatedly stripped of protection after years in which he was associated with the illegal pushback of migrants at sea in Easter 2020 and according to police intelligence seen by MaltaToday the shadowy world of fuel smuggling Amer Abdelrazek – aka Amer Barakat Zaky Abdel Razak – lost his status of subsidiary protection after losing a court case challenging the removal of his protection by the International Protection Agency IPA Subsidiary protection is an intermediate form of protection for an asylum claimant that is renewed periodically only until conditions in their country of origin make it safe for them to return The official reason for the cancellation of protection is that Abdelrazek 44 who is known to Maltese police had misrepresented information about a drug conviction in Egypt The IPA contends that while Abdelrazek did admit the drug charges he had willfully misrepresented it as an act of persecution by the Muslim Brotherhood Originally in April 2014 the IPA – then as the Commissioner for Refugees – denied his asylum claim But the refugee appeals board chaired by then-lawyer – now magistrate – Joseph Mifsud upheld his claim due to the upheavals in Egypt after the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian army Abdelrazek ’ s asylum claim had then been filed exactly one month after receiving an 18-month prison sentence suspended for three years for using a forged passport and false licensing for the boat the Golden Dawn on which he resided Abdelrazek ’ s subsidiary protection has been regularly renewed since then But in 2021 the IPA received information from the Malta police that he had been convicted for drug trafficking charges in Egypt receiving a life imprisonment sentence “ You are also known to the Maltese authorities as having been involved with serious organised crime groups dealing in fuel and contraband smuggling ” the IPA told Abdelrazek MaltaToday has seen a confidential police report attesting to this claim in which Abdelrazek ’ s name appears as an associate though not a core member of a Maltese organised crime group connected to drug trafficking Abdelrazek ’ s lawyers contested the revocation of his subsidiary protection insisting that their client was never once questioned by police and that he had a clean police conduct – despite the falsified passport charges he had been found gulity of The IPA countered that Abdelrazek had in his asylum claim first stated he was arrested on drug charges “ as he was walking next to a group of Muslim Brotherhood members ” then changed his version at appeals stage by claiming he was himself a member of the Muslim Brotherhood Abdelrazek who has lived in Malta since 2011 has been associated with suspicious seafaring activities in well-documented cases Indeed in the Easter of 2020 when Malta was under the COVID lockdown the Abela administration enforced a shutdown of ports that prevented the rescue of migrants at sea by NGOs It was Abdelrazek himself who admitted to the New York Times that the boat he commanded the Tremar was part of an unofficial pushback of migrants who were steaming towards the Maltese waters ironically to prevent them making their own bid to claim asylum The Tremar was one of three trawlers that on 12 April 2020 sailed out of Valletta – the other two were the Dar Al Salam 1 and the Salve Regina – all on order of Abdelrazek who in turn is believed to have been instructed by members of the Abela administration Former OPM official Neville Gafá has said in court that he was “ operating under Libyan jurisdiction ” when he coordinated the pushback of migrants at Malta ’ s request but denied instructing Abdelrazek in comments to MaltaToday The trawlers switched off their satellite tracking devices soon after leaving port to intercept a migrant vessel attempting to reach Malta and return it to the Libyan coastguard The Dar Al Salam 1 and the Tremar reached the migrant vessel on 14 April guided by a Maltese military helicopter Around 50 survivors were taken aboard the Dar Al Salam 1 and together with the Salve Regina returned to Tripoli on 15 April The Tremar waited in international waters Abdelrazek had told the NYT Fuel smuggling connection Abdelrazek is also a principal of two companies Daha Oil Gas and Rema Trading which have been identified by Italian police as being connected to ships that were involved in fuel smuggling near Hurd ’ s Bank One of these ships is the Bonnie B Abdelrazek is also implicated in another case involving ship owners from Italy and Malta whose complexity is illustrated by one particular event the arson of one lawyer Graziella Attard ’ s car on 16 October 2017 Abdelrazek and his brother Khaled Barakat Abdelrazek had filed a case against Attard and the company owning the fishing vessel Agostino Padre in 2016 claiming Attard had received a €23 million payment of which €13 million had to be paid back to them The understanding could have been down to an issue of Sharia law that prevented the Egyptian parties from partaking in an interest-bearing loan Attard filed a counter-claim against the Abdelrazek brothers and two players in the fuel business Italian national Claudio La Rosa of KB Petrols and Gordon Debono of Petroplus The latter ’ s name is especially notorious accused in both Malta and Italy in connection with the €30 million fuel smuggling ring intercepted in Operation Dirty Oil in 2017 Attard had claimed that the €23 million payment drafted by La Rosa as a settlement of debts with the previous owners of the Agostino Padre had been made “ after much pressure violence and fraud ” The former owners of the Agostino Padre had been debtors of La Rosa for the sum of €13 million before they sold the company on to Graziella Attard,"['Valletta', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard']","[(3324, 3332, 'LOC'), (4671, 4677, 'LOC'), (4783, 4789, 'LOC'),

victims of lawless development,04/02/2023 11:19,Relatives of Jean-Paul Sofia the young victim of Malta ’ s latest fatal construction accident railed against a broken system of rules on the industry and accused developers of taking their greed to the extreme “ This construction industry is stained with the blood of people like Jean-Paul Sofia we owe it to him and the other families affected by these deaths ” the relative said at a demonstration in which she called for a stringent set of rules for the industry The demonstration was led by Moviment Graffitti whose spokesperson Christine Cassar said the construction accidents that had claimed so many lives were “ inevitable consequences of a rotten system that sacrificed lives for developers ’ greed ” “ The deaths of Miriam Pace Jean Paul Sofia Rita Vella and the construction workers who died on site could have been avoided but their lives were sacrificed on the altar of greed ” Cassar said “ We can not stay silent construction is leaving numerous victims and innocent people dead and families are left broken-hearted “ We need intelligent laws harsh penalties for those who do not respect the rules effective inspections during various stages of construction better security standards – with facts and deeds we can not let greed command over us ” Sofia ’ s relative said OHSA bill to speed up inquiries A total of 87 magisterial inquiries into workplace deaths and injuries that have occurred over the last seven years remain open The list dating back to 2015 shows that magistrates are still investigating 29 workplace fatalities The bulk of the 29 workplace deaths on the list occurred on construction sites many foreigners who fell to their deaths such as that of 26-year-old Mabruk Abubaker Abdullatif who fell a height of several storeys at a construction site in Sliema But the magisterial inquiries are still open Another victim was Romeo Antonio Scolari 49 who fell from a height at a site in St Julian ’ s in March 2019 Malian national Dieidy Coulibaly fell four storeys at a construction site in Qawra in 2019 His inquiry is also still ongoing Occupational Health and Safety Authority CEO Mark Gauci recently told The Times that the authority was pushing for the bill to involve the OHSA in court investigations into workplace accidents to speed up the conclusions The bill seeking to speed up magisterial inquiries passed its first reading in parliament The OHSA oversees workplace safety and ensures the well-being of all workers in all workplaces but it is not involved in magisterial inquiries “ If the bill is passed we will see speedier conclusions justice acting faster and a stronger deterrent effect ” Gauci said Graffiti call out rotten system Exactly two months ago the lifeless body of 20-year-old Jean Paul Sofia was found under the rubble of a collapsed building in Corradino Five other workers were seriously injured in the incident three of them critically Only three years ago on 2 March 2020 Miriam Pace was killed in her home after the whole building collapsed as a result of construction works on an adjacent site “ The workplace death of construction workers has also become a monthly occurrence and thousands are injured on construction sites every year ” Graffitti spokesperson Christine Cassar said yesterday “ These are not tragic accidents but the inevitable consequence of a rotten system designed to satisfy the insatiable hunger for the profit of developers and other businesses in the construction sector The deaths of Jean Paul Sofia Miriam Pace and all construction workers who perished at their workplaces were preventable Their lives have been sacrificed at the altar of greed ” No one has been yet charged in connection with Sofia ’ s death “ Real justice for all the victims of the construction industry will only be served when the systemic factors that have allowed this rot to fester are addressed ” Cassar said Relatives of fatality victims and Graffitti yesterday called for a public inquiry into the death of Sofia in a bid to go beyond identifying individual responsibility and uncover systemic failures “ Tragically the reform promised in the wake of Miriam Pace ’ s death has failed to materialize beyond a few cosmetic changes ” Cassar said Graffitti said that four crucial factors underlined the systemic failures that were leading to construction deaths The licensing of contractors “ bitterly opposed from behind the scenes by the developers ” which would ensure that operators in the construction sector are trustworthy and adequately trained with a mechanism by which licenses can be revoked when operators engage in malpractices There are currently no laws that regulate basic aspects of the construction process such as what construction machinery and material can be used where and how The NGO also said the Building and Construction Authority BCA established two years ago had become “ another dysfunctional authority seized by developers ’ interests ” chaired by architect Maria Schembri Grima one of the main architects of some of Malta ’ s most ruthless developers such as Joseph Portelli and Michael Stivala “ The BCA has very little to show for its work The reforms it should have been spearheading have stalled and enforcement in the construction industry remains far from sufficient ” Additionally the lack of planning reforms was evident by the fact that the four-storey building which collapsed in Corradino that killed Sofia had been given the go-ahead by means of two Development Notification Orders DNOs low-level permits that allow applicants to bypass the planning system and build entire structures on the strength of a mere notification without any serious evaluation of the building project “ The failure to reform the deadly construction industry lies in the power of developers to veto any serious measure that can safeguard people ’ s safety and quality of life It is truly shameful and worrying that Government is willing to accede to this lobby ’ s demands instead of protecting the workers and residents in Malta and Gozo ” Cassar said,['Sliema'],"[(1783, 1789, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/120635/dirty_coal_accounts_for_13_of_imported_electricity,Dirty coal accounts for 13% of imported electricity,10/01/2023 07:50,Coal the dirtiest fuel in terms of carbon emissions has accounted for one-tenth of the electricity imported by Malta from the European mainland through the interconnector And with 6 of that electricity derived from nuclear power stations the imported mix is radically different from 2020 ’ s figures when coal accounted for 17 and nuclear over a tenth Malta is powered by both a liquefied natural gas plant LNG as well as an electricity interconnector that provides energy from the European mainland by subsea cable from Sicily Natural gas is estimated to emit 50-60 less carbon dioxide CO2 when combusted by new and efficient plants compared to emissions from a coal-burning plant But while the emissions from these imported fossil fuels are not produced in the Maltese plant they still contribute to global warming unlike renewable and nuclear energy whose carbon footprint is negligible Energy from the interconnector accounted for one-fifth of the total energy mix of the island in 2021 which means the actual share of coal in Malta ’ s energy mix in 2021 was 3 Nuclear energy also accounted for 6 of imported electricity in 2021 down from 11 in 2020 Nuclear energy is cleaner than coal and natural gas in terms of carbon emissions but is shunned by environmentalists because of the radioactive waste it produces and fears of nuclear fallout from major accidents like Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 Enemalta statistics show that 83 of the energy imported from Italy in 2021 was derived from fossil fuels which in varying degrees contribute to global warming In contrast renewable energy only accounted for a tenth of imported electricity in both 2020 and 2021 down from 15 in 2019 According to a Central Bank study based on 2019 statistics when imported renewables are added to locally produced renewable energy Malta would exceed the EU mandated 10 threshold for electricity being supplied from renewable sources But the report also called for more investment in renewable energy because Malta still failed to reach the mandatory threshold to have 10 of its total energy supply from locally produced renewables in 2020 having to resort to buying energy credits from other countries In 2020 Malta acquired €2 million in renewable energy “ credits ” from Estonia to reach its EU targets for that year and it had previously also entered in a €14 million seven-year deal with Bulgaria for 2013-2020 Malta should stop importing coal and nuclear energy – Friends of the Earth Friends of the Earth one of the few local environmental groups focused on energy issue is calling on the Maltese government not to accept coal and nuclear as part of the country ’ s energy mix “ Fossil fuels are proving unreliable expensive and incompatible with greenhouse gas emission reduction targets to avoid climate catastrophe Nuclear energy remains a challenge due to safety risks the lack of solutions for the long-term waste problem and the dangers of proliferation ” Suzanne Maas the Climate Campaign Coordinator of Friends of the Earth Malta told MaltaToday But with the rise in the cost of energy triggered by the invasion of Ukraine governments across Europe are scrambling to find alternatives to Russian gas Faced with increased reliance on coal the German government which includes the Green Party has reluctantly slowed down the closure of nuclear plants and more EU governments are investing in offshore LNG plants like the one in Marsaxlokk But FOE opposes further investment in fossil fuels including the EU-approved gas pipeline from Malta to Italy which it fears will further lock Malta ’ s fossil fuel dependence and argues that the only way to really safeguard Malta ’ s energy security and “ protect people and businesses from external shocks ” is for government to invest in the energy of future “ energy savings renewables and community energy ” Reducing energy use in buildings operations and transport may well be “ the cheapest and fastest way to decrease energy consumption and save money ” This can be achieved through building renovations stricter standards for the energy performance of new buildings and a modal shift to cleaner modes of transport public transport walking cycling supported by the right fiscal incentives to reward the positive shift and tax wasteful behaviour Moreover Malta also needs to urgently increase its share of renewable

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/120526/what_lies_in_store_for_the_economy_in_2023,What lies in store for the economy in 2023?,03/01/2023 06:00,We entered 2022 with promises of economic hope in what was expected to be a year of booming commercial activity as countries planned pandemic exit strategies But the hope quickly diminished when Russian president Vladimir Putin announced his ‘ special military operation ’ in Ukraine wreaking further havoc to supply chains already strained from COVID-19 Gas supplies were also put under pressure hampering full economic recovery in many in countries MaltaToday spoke to economists Clint Flores and Stephanie Fabri and EY 's Ronald Attard strategy and transactions leader for central eastern and southeastern Europe and central Asia to see which factors will continue to shape the local economy next year and what new factors could crop up in 2023 1 War In Ukraine Attard It is impossible to say when the war will end Of course the first thoughts go out to the people in Ukraine who face the immediate and brutal consequences of war in their country But there are also economic consequences of the war across the globe including Malta These consequences include supply bottlenecks raw material shortages increases in energy prices which have been shielded to date in Malta and inflation And as a consequence of inflation increased interest rates… Flores The war in Ukraine and its outcome after this winter is what will mainly affect the world Indeed gas shortages in Europe and persistent inflationary pressures might send the eurozone economy into a recession Normally in a recession inflation subsides However economic shocks will definitely affect the euro currency and its governance Certainly the main attention would primarily fall on Italy ’ s debt stock and Germany ’ s industrial production shortages which would limit the latters growth due to the gas dependency of its economy The Italian and the German economies are two of the largest in the eurozone and thereby they can affect the stability of the currency If the euro depreciates due to persistent economic shocks and in tandem inflation does not subside relative to the global interest rate hikes due to supply side shortages imports would become dearer This means that in the medium term inflation will persist risking a stagnation in Europe ’ s economy … Unless a peace agreement is found global stability won ’ t be restored We are going to see additional conflicts in 2023 in many regions around the globe 2 The Labour market Fabri In Malta and across the EU the labour market has been experiencing shifts in terms of high demand and low supply This labour market situation has been putting increasing pressure on the economy through higher business costs and higher demand amongst other factors which spiraled inflation A calmer labour market situation is highly unlikely and this this will continue causing economic stress amongst market players especially given the wide-ranging disruptions that are shaping and occurring throughout the world of work 3 Reactions to interest rate hikes Attard As the cost of capital continues to go up following the successive hikes in interest rates put in place by central banks 2023 will see companies households and investors deal with the full impact of this change in monetary policy stance We ’ ll see increased interest in the bond market as coupons are again going above the 5 mark companies trying to offload certain assets as bank funding takes its toll and companies looking at acquisition opportunities to sustain their growth plans The cost of capital is also going up for governments which are also battling higher deficits due to the pandemic and the impacts of the energyinflation crisis – this will mean increased opportunities for the private sector to assist in co-funding some projects of a public-private nature 4 Inflation Fabri The implications of COVID-19 and the Russia- Ukraine war on inflationary pressures over the recent years have had a significant impact on governments businesses and consumers This is a result of supply-chain shortages caused by these events and a concoction of other economic factors through which their interplay caused economic pressures Some experts are predicting that the worst is yet to come whilst others are stating that wage growth will be higher than inflation in the coming year If inflationary pressures persist in this significant manner they will continue having an influence on the quantity and quality of investment and other market choices by businesses and consumers It will also be more difficult for governments to focus on the long- term economy in relation to environmental investment and digitalization There also the possibility that these inflationary pressures will weigh on growth and lead to stagflation Flores Inflation might persist longer than expected as it is a supply side problem not a demand side If that is the case then we might risk longer periods of inflation even in Malta The European economy and its labour market is different to that of the US Wages in Europe are sticky downwards relative to that of the USA ’ s labour markets Due to the gas shortages in 2023 some companies might need to readjust their production levels This might create a shortage in private investment Capital has already become more expensive due to higher interest rates and therefore private investors might postpone investment decisions which in turn affects unemployment In terms of prices Malta is more competitive given that the government is absorbing the energy inflation I think that Malta will avoid a recession due to its competitiveness and its agile economy which adjusts easily to each and every global circumstance An important step in 2023 is to make sure that business sentiment remains high and consumer confidence too and we take the opportunity to transit to greener practices On a separate note we must promote the circular economy further to cut on unnecessary costs in times of abnormal inflation The principle of collecting plastic is a great step in the right direction However the beverage container deposit must be efficiently and effectively collected to avoid additional increases in inflation expectations and unnecessary inflationary pressures 5 Business readiness Fabri The economic situation is based on high levels of economic volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity VUCA Businesses need to shift this situation by creating a vision create the means to have more clarity and a better understanding of how the current situation is affecting them and become more agile It is easier said than done given the complexity characterizing the economy at present However with the right inspiration and people on board it is not impossible Future competitiveness depends on businesses who manage to take advantage of the present Foreseeing the future has become difficult with the VUCA situation Stakeholders should thus proactive and thus prepare a reaction for the different scenarios that could take place 6 Approval of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards by the European Parliament Attard These reporting standards are the equivalent of the accounting IFRS ’ s and focus on standardising sustainability reporting under the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive which starts impacting some of the largest local companies for financial year 2024 About 12 ESRS ’ s are expected to be approved There will be a gradual trickling down to smaller firms either directly through their reporting requirements or indirectly by getting requests from their larger supply chain partners What it means for the local economy is that many firms will gradually need to start ingraining sustainability reporting into their processes – from strategy to governance to IT architecture Initially many will see it as a cost – the more forward-looking leaders will realise this is required to maintain competitiveness and eventually can be a source of competitive advantage 7 Getting closer to price parity for electric vehicles Attard We ’ ve seen an increased take-up of hybrid and fully electric vehicles here in Malta mainly driven by the generous government grants but also as people realise there are advantages to be gained in having a cleaner and smoother mobility tool However there is still a feeling that these large grants are possibly helping higher income households while one of the key principles the EU harps about is a just transition – one hopes that 2023 should see us make a step closer to price parity ICEA vehicles vs EVs 8 US property market Flores Economic forecasts are based on historical data projected to the future and I hasten to add that some outliers even by US economists are not being captured in such forecasts such as the property market ’ s reaction to the persistent increase in interest rates If the USA ’ s property market is affected it might send additional shockwaves to the financial markets in Europe which might create a global contagion effect akin to the one of 2008 Clearly we must avoid another economic shock as that would be fatal for many economies around the world 9 Gas storages Flores Personally I believe that if Europe does not manage to fill up gas storages in time for 2023 it would create additional instability especially if diplomatic relations now also with Qatar degenerate That instability might erode private investors ’ sentiment and consumer spending which are all important components of aggregate demand The dip in business sentiment and consumer spending will take longer to recover due to the post-COVID economic shocks and the ensuing slow recovery of the labour market Several workers left the retail sector consumer spending was eroded due to income losses emanating from the closure of the retail sector in response to the pandemic and the ensuing energy and food inflationary pressures further eroded the disposable income of workers,"['Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard']","[(532, 538, 'LOC'), (765, 771, 'LOC'), (2961, 2967, 'LOC'),

expected to deliver judgment in January on the case instituted by PN MP Adrian Delia to have the hospitals privatisation contract rescinded The judgment will determine the fate of the concession agreement the future of American operator Steward Health Care and government ’ s plans for the sector 2 Small Nations Games come to Malta Puka the lampuka-inspired mascot will welcome athletes from nine countries competing in the 19th edition of the Games of the Small States of Europe to be held in Malta between 28 May and 3 June Athletes will compete in 10 sporting disciplines and Malta will hope for a better performance than that in Montenegro in 2019 when it won 27 medals and placed sixth 3 Valletta flies the rainbow flag Valletta will host EuroPride a pan-European event dedicated to LGBT pride between 7 and 17 September The celebration will be the largest gathering of diversity Malta has ever seen LQBTI human rights issues will take centre stage in the event billed as ‘ Equality From The Heart ’ 4 Aborting the presidency In January parliament is expected to conclude deliberations on the Criminal Code amendment to allow a pregnancy to be terminated if a woman ’ s life or health is in danger Government will tweak the proposal but George Vella ’ s moral convictions on abortion could be tested leading him to abort the presidency prematurely 5 Metro feasibility study Will this be the year Malta finally sees light at the end of the metro tunnel The numbers will inform the decision on financial feasibility and these could be expected later on this year Whether an actual decision is made to embark on this ambitious multi-billion-euro project remains to be seen 6 A sexual health policy is born At long last Malta will have an adjourned sexual health policy more than a decade and a radically-changed society after the first such policy was enacted Crucial will be how abortion is dealt with given the latest legal developments 7 Bring on Italy and England Malta ’ s Euro2024 cup adventure starts in March but the highlights of this qualifying stage will be the games against Italy and England Malta plays Italy at Ta ’ Qali on 26 March and England on 16 June The away game against Italy will be played on 14 October and against England on 17 November 8 20 years since EU referendum In March it will be 20 years since Malta voted in favour of EU accession in a referendum a result confirmed in a general election a month later It won ’ t be much of a national celebration but it is an occasion the Nationalist Party would like to milk especially since the 2003 election was the last time the party enjoyed an absolute majority in the country 9 Yorgen Fenech trial The man accused of masterminding the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia Yorgen Fenech may finally face judgment day in court after more than three years Although no date has been set for his trial it is likely to be held sometime in 2023 unless complicated legal challenges keep pushing the date further down the line 10 Food prices will bite With consumers shielded from higher energy and fuel prices it will be food and services that will chip away at spending power The statutory wage increase of €990 per week from January and other budgetary measures such as the higher Children ’ s Allowance will cushion some of the impact But food inflation will remain a headache 11 Ukraine war will drag on Russia may attempt a second multi-pronged ground attack in the east south and north of Ukraine as the winter months subside or Ukrainian forces will continue their gradual advance and recapture more territory In either case the war is likely to drag on for months severely testing European unity over continued military aid to Ukraine and Vladimir Putin ’ s permanence in Moscow 12 Military flare ups elsewhere China ’ s lacklustre economic performance could trigger something more than sabre-rattling over Taiwan while North Korea will continue to test its southern neighbour ’ s patience In the Balkans the Serbia-Kosovo border could become a flashpoint for conflict while Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s flagging fortunes ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in June could prompt a skirmish with Greece over oil exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean 13 Crypto rules The collapse of crypto exchange FTX and its founder ’ s arraignment on charges of fraud money laundering and breaking US election campaign finance coupled with Bitcoin ’ s 60 decline in 2022 have shaken the foundations of cryptocurrency In 2023 expect central bankers and governments to intensify efforts to try and tame the crypto system through consumer protection regulations Whether they will succeed is another story altogether 14 Heat waves ice spells and floods The impacts of climate change will continue to be felt all-over the world From suffocating longer and more frequent heat waves in the summer to massive cold storms in winter from rivers running dry in some months to unspeakable floods in others climate change will continue to put the lives of 8 billion humans at risk 15 Airport junction works reprieve Works on the two massive road projects outside the airport and Luqa will finally come to an end by June bringing reprieve to residents and tourists alike The flyovers and tunnels will provide seamless travel to and from the area but pressure will increase to solve the bottleneck at the Qormi roundabout known as Tal-Imgħallaq 16 Malta on the Security Council Malta takes its seat at the UN Security Council in January for the start of its two-year term This is only the second time that Malta will sit on one of the UN ’ s highest decision-making bodies the other time being 1983-84 Malta ’ s stated goal is to be ‘ a voice for justice moderation understanding and tolerance ’ with a commitment to global dialogue How to do this at a time of heightened global tension remains to be seen 17 King Charles III coronation The coronation of King Charles III will take place on 6 May

which would also mean they would have to surface Neither had she carried out a free ascent to the surface while continuously breathing out to avoid barotrauma to her lungs Had Castillo followed his buddy to the surface there would have been two incidents said the experts concluding that Gauci might have suffered a cardiac arrhythmia which caused shortness of breath leading to an instinctive quick ascent to the surface in search of air The specialist explained that Gauci had been tired before diving and had been using a dry suit that was too big for her causing it to trap too much air Besides being too large the suit was also defective She had not been trained on how to use a dry suit or maintain its buoyancy In his report to the magisterial inquiry a doctor specialising in hyperbaric medicine also concluded that a combination of fatigue an ill-fitting dry suit which the victim had not been trained to use and compressed air “ supplied by an unlicensed operator with questionable maintenance on compressor ” were all factors in the fatal accident With regards to Gauci ’ s dive computer he noted that “ although the diving computer ’ s setting is not overtly dangerous in itself its setting at its most aggressive setting speaks to the diver ’ s general demeanour towards risk taking ” However the report also concluded that negligence and omissions were evident from Castillo ’ s side “ The whole scope of the diving buddy system is for the two divers to be close to each other to assist each other in any untoward event during the dive The assumption that Ms Gauci was safe on the surface and swimming back to shore when no such contact and reasoning was made between the two divers proved to be highly significant as it ensured the omission of a rescue attempt ” Magistrate Simone Grech observed that although Castillo had done what was required of him as a dive buddy for the majority of the dive he had failed to do so during the final part of the dive He had assumed that Gauci was swimming to the surface had only seen her grasping her Nitrox 50 decompression cylinder and had not re-established eye contact with her At that late stage in the dive he had stopped asking her how much air she had left despite having been monitoring her high rate of air consumption earlier on From her dive profile it was established that only 20 minutes into the dive at a depth of 10 metres Gauci had already consumed 70 bars of the 200 she had started off with The last time Castillo had checked with Gauci she had 110 bars left after which they spent 25 minutes ascending before the final incident They had not taken into account the fact that Gauci was using an open circuit scuba diving apparatus whilst Castillo had been using a closed-circuit rebreather system which created a discrepancy that would persist throughout the dive It was noted that as Castillo had been using a closed-circuit rebreather system “ he was not in the right frameset of checking on his open circuit buddy seeing he had no issues with length of gas supply it was not within his procedures during the dive or second nature to his skill set to check his buddy ’ s different and finite air supply ” The court noted that the report specified that Castillo ’ s claim of being unable to follow Gauci as she ascended because he needed to decompress had been disproven by his decompression computer “ A two-minute deco obligation at five minutes is never an impediment to seek a lost diving buddy ” the report read The accused had made many assumptions in the circumstances surrounding the dive said the court ruling it to be evident that Gauci had been in difficulty and that Castillo had an obligation to ensure his dive buddy was safe and not simply to assume that she was safe Magistrate Simone Grech presiding the Court of Magistrates in Gozo said she was morally convinced that the accused ’ s failure to carry out a rescue attempt while assuming that Gauci was safe was negligent and had contributed to Gauci ’ s tragic death The court said that the tragedy could have easily been avoided by the accused “ had he exercised the caution and prudence evidently needed in the circumstances ” Although the evidence had established an element of contributory negligence on the part of the victim this did not in any way exonerate the accused of criminal responsibility for what happened ruled the court Castillo was handed a two-year prison sentence which was suspended for four years and ordered to pay two thirds of the costs of appointing experts to the inquiry Inspector Josef Gauci prosecuted,['Sliema'],"[(196, 202, 'LOC')]"

Bay development appeal next Thursday,30/10/2022 14:09,The Environment Planning Review Tribunal will be handing a decision on Ħondoq Bay over an appeal filed by developers who want to build a hotel in the area Gozo Prestige Holidays ’ application had been turned down for the development of a hotel and parking facilities as well as 25 villas 60 apartments and 200 multi-owner properties The decision on the appeal on the refusal of a PA permit for the development of the valley will be handed on Thursday The developers appealed the refusal arguing their right to a fair hearing had been denied leaving them with insufficient time to bring forward the experts who had authored studies in support of the application Issuing a statement before the decision Qala Mayor Paul Buttigieg who has been on the front line against the decision called on the area to remain as it is “ We hope that Hondoq Bay will be preserved for those who love it and for future generations ” he said “ Gozo needs to safeguard its natural capital and not become intensely developed and spoilt How Hondoq was underhandedly earmarked for tourism In 2002 the company Gozo Prestige owned by Gozitan businessmen Victor Bajada presented an application for the construction of a destination port and 195-room hotel 200-yacht marina and a tourist village for 300 apartments The land had been sold to the developers by the Augustinian order The Order sold the land on promise of sale to Bajada in 1988 for Lm10200 €23760 – on condition that full development permits were awarded The promise of sale states that if development permission for the land is granted the Order will receive the full sale price of Lm10000 €23294 per tumulo and at 68 tumuli the total sale price amounting to Lm680000 €1583974 But the draft for the Gozo local plan issued for public consultation in 2002 never made any reference to tourist development in Ħondoq It limited itself to saying that MEPA would consider proposals from public agencies to upgrade beach facilities at Ħondoq ir-Rummien Any envisaged development was limited to the rehabilitation of the quarry the provision of basic beach amenities and unrestricted public access to the beach A new Gozo local plan approved in 2006 facilitated the approval of a tourism project referring to “ tourism and marine related uses ” and “ sensitively designed high quality and low density buildings that blend into the landscape ” Ħondoq was identified as the site of a “ destination port ” – a euphemism for a yacht marina Indeed the authors of a project development statement for the developers immediately after the publication of the local plan referred to the delay between 2002 and 2006 as “ four years of pro-active consultation ” with the Malta Environment and Planning Authority So while MEPA was consulting with the developer no public consultation was conducted on the changes made in the local plan The developers made bold claims as to their development being an environmentally friendly one Through landscaping they promised to create the perception that the project was the “ work of nature itself ” and to create the impression that the new village had “ evolved organically over the last century ” Clearly back then the wind was in their sail to the extent that even Gozo Minister Giovanna Debono described the Ħondoq project as beneficial to Gozo But the goalposts changed after 2008 Facing an uphill election the PN successfully reinvented itself as a more environmentally-friendly party Upon being re-elected Lawrence Gonzi even declared a zero-tolerance stance towards ODZ development For environmentalists Ħondoq became the litmus test for the seriousness of the government ’ s intentions Moreover the project contrasted with the PN ’ s own eco-Gozo vision In August 2011 MEPA ’ s environmental arm – the Environment Protection Directorate – called on the authority to refuse the project MEPA ’ s Planning Directorate was just about to issue its final case officer report when the developers presented new plans dropping the marina replacing it with a swimming lagoon and retaining the residential aspect of the project But MEPA insisted that it could not consider new plans at this stage insisting that a brand new application was needed The Labour opposition was also committed against the project But no final decision was taken about the project before the change in government in 2013 In 2016 following a 14-year long saga the PA unanimously refused the application for the Ħondoq ir-Rummien development – a deluxe 5-star hotel with 110 bedrooms 20 self-catering villas 60 apartments serviced by the hotel 203 apartments 1249 underground parking spaces a village centre – which was to include a church and shops – and a yacht marina for approximately 100 to 150 berths The Ħondoq development was deemed by the Planning Directorate to be in breach of the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development as it constituted “ a dense urban development ” in a “ coastal rural area ” It was also in breach of the SPED ’ s vision of Gozo as an “ ecological island ” But the developers refused to give up and appealed “ The PA has no right to go back on its commitments arrived at through its own actions and after having induced the applicant to incur hundreds of thousands of euros in costs and expenses to comply with the PA ’ s request for studies ” architect Edward Bencini claimed in the appeal presented to the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal Surprisingly two years later the Environment and

Marsaskala car bomb and almost seven years later his wife has been left questioning who carried out the hit Cachia was killed when his car blew up while he was driving along the Marsaskala bypass in 2016 He was a registered fisherman and had pending charges for drug trafficking human smuggling and contraband cigarettes Nobody has been charged with his murder and his wife Elena Cachia has been unable to get any answers from the police She speaks with MaltaToday about her husband his illegal affairs and lifts the lid on how Martin grew anxious in the months before the murder Elena married her husband in 2013 after dating him for nine years As they got married Martin appointed her director to all of his companies to avoid any inheritance issues down the line After he was killed Elena was left battling several court cases to try and reclaim her husband ’ s companies and put the business back in action She says her husband grew anxious in the months before his murder “ He would tell me not to come in the car with him ” she said suggesting that he knew he was being targeted He had also expressed a wish to leave Malta entirely “ He said ‘ I want to run away from Malta leave somewhere and you join me later after I send you a ticket ’ ” Elena recounts Between the pending charges and his fishing business Elena believes that it was Martin ’ s fuel-smuggling operations that made him a target Cachia ’ s license allowed him to sail into international waters According to Elena her husband would sail out into the middle of the sea between Libya and Malta Fuel would be loaded onto Cachia ’ s vessel and another boat would come and pick up the load Cachia was already known to police as a fuel smuggler He was a person of interest in a police probe into the smuggling of fuel from Libya He also faced human trafficking charges after his fishing vessel the Liberty V was impounded by police officers when they received a tip-off that 20 irregular immigrants were on board Liberty Fishing Company which owned the Liberty V was indeed owned by Elena who was written down as the director legal and judicial representative and company secretary When he was arrested in 2013 Martin Cachia had refused to answer any questions during his interrogation over the human trafficking allegations But his Egyptian crew soon changed their story From rescuing sailors in distress the crew recounted how the Liberty V had encountered problems with the vessel ’ s bilge pump They had contacted Cachia who at first instructed them to return to shore but shortly afterwards called up a crew member and told him to stand fast and await another vessel that was sailing to their location to pick up their cargo of around 70 boxes of Russian vodka After the two vessels got alongside each other and before transferring the alcohol the Liberty crew said that between 28 and 42 passengers embarked on their vessel from the other boat The other boat had a Libyan crew The passengers included around five women and four or five children who they said were “ probably Syrian ” The Liberty reached land at Ras Ħanżir beneath Corradino Hill in the Grand Harbour and had successfully offloaded part of its human cargo into a van before drugs squad police arrived on the scene The officers were told by the crew that around 20 people remained on board the vessel Car bomb raised more questions than answers Cachia ’ s car went up in flames on 16 January at around 915am as he was driving through Triq il-Latmija on Marsaskala ’ s bypass The car blew up after an explosive device went off The driver lost control of the vehicle which hurtled along the road for around 100m before crashing into a nearby wall At the time police were not ruling anything Former assistant commissioner Silvio Valletta had said they could not conclusively say the death was a homicide due to the dynamics of the explosion Since the bomb was most likely inside the car when it went off police had to establish whether someone placed the bomb inside the car with the intention of killing Cachia or whether Cachia was knowingly transporting the bomb somewhere else Elena is convinced that the bomb was placed in the car by a third party especially given her husband ’ s behaviour before the murder This wouldn ’ t be far-fetched in hindsight Most of the car bombs that had taken place in prior years saw the explosives placed underneath the car which is what probably led police to consider the possibility that Martin may have been transporting the bomb But if Martin was assassinated his death would have been the first episode in a series where car bombs started being placed inside the vehicle Testimony given during the compilation of evidence into the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia gives an insight into how this could have been pulled off Superintendent Keith Arnaud had described how Robert Agius known as Tal-Maksar had acquired a vehicle similar to the one used by Caruana Galizia so that her executioners could practice lock-breaking The Caruana Galizia bomb had been placed underneath the driver ’ s seat with no apparent sign of break-in and was triggered remotely by a text message sent to a SIM card placed inside the bomb It remains unclear whether the bomb that killed Cachia had the same dynamics as the Caruana Galizia one In her blog the murdered journalist had pointed out a pattern among the criminal assassinations from the past decades “ Diesel smugglers are blown up by bombs in their cars and drug smugglers are shot dead by hired hitmen ” she wrote “ The diesel smugglers are described as ‘ fishermen ’ or ‘ restaurateurs ’ and the drug smugglers are called long-distance lorry drivers or hauliers or ‘ unemployed family men ’ or ‘ businessmen ’ though some of them are occasionally described as ‘ known to the police ’ ” Caruana Galizia had said Martin Cachia and Pierre Darmanin She referred to one man Josef Cassar also a victim of a car bomb while he was driving along Marsa ’ s December 13 Road Caruana Galizia alleged that Cassar was a diesel smuggler linked to the MV Silverking a vessel owned by Silver King Ltd “ whose only shareholders are Pierre Darmanin black sheep of the well-respected Tan-Niksu family of Żurrieq and his estranged wife Annabelle ” Caruana Galizia said the vessel was impounded by Customs three years prior and Darmanin was named in a police and customs investigation into a diesel-smuggling ring Darmanin went on to call the journalist to clarify his position in relation to this blog post He told her that his company sold the MV Silverking when it was released from impound three years before But according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica after hanging up from Caruana Galizia Darmanin first called Economy Minister Chris Cardona followed by Alfred Degiorgio – one of the three hitmen convicted so far with Caruana Galizia ’ s murder Darmanin has always denied wrongdoing but his name had also appeared in court proceedings that concerned Martin Cachia Court records included a letter signed by Darmanin dated 11 December 2015 asking an unspecified recipient to allow Cachia to travel with him to Egypt But Darmanin told Caruana Galizia that his signature was forged by Cachia Elena tells MaltaToday that the purpose of this particular trip was to bring a large vessel to Malta from Damietta in Egypt The vessel had a large space underneath to store fuel she says Whether this particular case had any bearing on her husband ’ s demise she can not tell The Cachia car bombing is one of several unsolved cases in which powerful bombs were used to eliminate criminals smugglers and traffickers These bombings culminated in the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017 Almost seven years since Cachia ’ s demise his wife is convinced her husband was murdered but like many others she remains in the dark as to who may have ordered his death and who carried out the hit Car bombs since 2016 16

boards,28/10/2022 07:31,Malta lags far behind its EU counterparts on gender balance in businesses as the European Council green-lights new rules for publicly-listed companies to have a more balanced board of directors Under the new directive which will have to be transposed by each Member State by 2026 at least 40 of non-executive director positions in listed companies should be held by members of the under-represented sex While the proportion of women on the boards of the largest publicly-listed companies reached 30 in EU Member States women only account for 99 of board members in Malta Brussels has been planning to force listed companies to reserve at least 40 of non-executive director board seats for women since at least 2012 Malta initially opposed such plans which would directly affect government-participant companies like Bank of Valletta and other publicly-listed companies like HSBC Malta GO pls Farsons and Maltapost If member states choose to apply the EU ’ s new rule to executive and non-executive director positions the target can be reduced to at least 33 of all director positions by the same year If a listed company fails to achieve this objective the company would have to adjust their selection process and put in place a fair and transparent selection and appointment procedures Companies would have to provide information about the gender representation of their boards at least once a year together with information on the measures in place to reach the 33 or 40 target Member states will publish a list of all the companies that have reached this target on an annual basis A spokesperson for the Parliamentary Secretary for Reforms and Equality said government welcomes the compromise reached by the Council and European Parliament in favour of the directive That being said to date the Directive has not yet been published in the EU ’ s Official Journal Following such publication government will have two years to transpose this Directive During this period government shall consult with key stakeholders in the field to seek the best way forward on the implementation of this Directive for Malta Joseph Portelli chairman of the Malta Stock Exchange told MaltaToday that this was good legislation “ Research suggests women are more risk-averse than men so women on boards I believe will have a stabilising effect on the management of a company ” However Portelli holds one concern over the implementation of the directive “ People shouldn ’ t be fired from boards to make room for women in my opinion I think the way forward is to have the directive grandfathered in As positions are made available women can fill them ” “ I also think there should be an opt-out rule If the company is very small or services a niche area where specialised skills are necessary and only men can be reasonably found then I believe that should be permitted ” Indeed SMEs with fewer than 250 employees are excluded from the scope of the directive Marisa Xuereb President of the Chamber of Commerce said that improving gender balance in the corporate world is a positive step in principle There is ample research that shows that companies that have more diverse boards and management teams perform better and it is not difficult to understand why Diversity brings different perspectives to the table and stimulates more creativity and objective thinking However Xuereb sees two sides to the issue Progress in gender balance has been marginal in most countries including Malta If policymakers do not take a proactive approach to the issue it would take decades to achieve a healthier board composition But on the other hand gender quotas can backfire if women are appointed to reach a quota and not because of capabilities This is the pitfall we must avoid There are plenty of capable women and those companies that are not tapping into female talent are effectively losing out We augur that they will make the effort to pick female board members who will bring substance and dynamism to their boards Another issue for company boards is the power of incumbency according to Xuereb In practice the challenge is more likely to be the power of incumbency of long-serving directors which at times makes it difficult for companies not only to introduce female board members but also to introduce younger males The challenges of today 's business world demand a combination of experience energy and versatility even at board level Boards need to up their game not just with respect to governance and compliance issues but also with respect to strategy risk-management and performance in turbulent economic times Gone are the days when companies can afford to have boards that are there just to tick the boxes In reaction to government 's statement Nationalist Party spokesperson Peter Agius said that government spent 10 years negotiating against this Directive and will now wait until the legislation is published before taking any action Meanwhile Malta is at the bottom of the European graph with only 9 of company board positions taken up by women,['Valletta'],"[(824, 832, 'LOC')]"

trafficking,03/08/2022 08:04,Fraudulent labour recruitment in Malta remained a significant concern for the US State Department as flagged in its annual Trafficking in People report for 2022 The report points to illegal recruitment fees the nature of work permits and a lack of oversight on massage parlours as areas of concern in Malta ’ s labour market vis-a-vis human trafficking In 2021 Malta ’ s national employment authority reportedly conducted 1400 routine inspections on employers with a focus on employment contracts and basic employment conditions But government did not report on whether labour inspectors received specialised training to identify trafficking victims identified any trafficking victims or referred any cases for investigation Additionally the US State Department noted that Malta ’ s employment laws did not allow workers to be charged recruitment fees by employment or recruitment agencies “ However this practice continued to occur and the government did not report effective law enforcement measures taken to deter agencies from continuing the practice ” MaltaToday had revealed last year that recruitment agencies operating for local food delivery companies had been taking a 50 cut from couriers ’ wages while charging recruitment fees of several thousand euro The report added to fraudulent labour recruitment would also take the form of traffickers replacing the originally-signed contract with a less favourable one when the worker arrives in Malta Sometimes traffickers would force victims to perform a completely different job than what was agreed upon or even confiscate the passports of victims upon arrival The precarious position of foreign workers and asylum-seekers was made worse by the fact that they can not leave their employers without prior government permission This is because work permits are tied to a specific employer which could increase their vulnerability to trafficking GRETA and NGOs had reported a lack of oversight and regulation on the licensing of massage parlours which had a higher likelihood of indicators of sex trafficking Indeed GRETA had already relayed the concerns of civil society that police did not proactively identify trafficking victims in massage parlours Prosecution and investigation The report notes that human trafficking investigations decreased in 2022 compared to the previous year while pointing to a lack of coordination among ministries For the 2021 period government did not report prosecuting or convicting any traffickers – also marking a decrease compared to the year prior The US State Department remarked on the 17-year delay of a trial against a former police officer who had been accused of and eventually admitted to the facilitation of sex trafficking An investigation was first initiated in 2004 against a former police officer who had allegedly acted as an accomplice to a convicted sex trafficker by falsifying visa documents He admitted to procuring a victim but was eventually acquitted in June 2021 This concern reflects what had been flagged by the Council of Europe ’ s expert group on human trafficking GRETA The report had urged the Maltese authorities to ensure that human trafficking cases lead to effective proportionate and dissuasive sanctions More so trafficking convictions continued to get overturned due to technicalities In February 2022 a judge ruled that a Balzan brothel-owner ’ s case had to be re-heard due to a technical flaw in the proceedings A month earlier the courts handed a suspended sentence on what the US State Department described as an “ alleged case of forced labour ” A 39-year-old Maltese woman kept another woman locked in a tiny room where should would assemble Playmobil dolls that could then be sold on to the company ’ s factory The victim was held in squalid conditions surrounded by dog faeces and forced to use a bucket as a toilet Victim identification According to the report Aġenzija Appoġġ identified 18 potential foreign trafficking victims in 2021 From the victims identified 11 were victims of labour trafficking including four victims of domestic servitude and one victim of forced criminality Five others were identified as victims of sex trafficking and two were victims of both sex and labour trafficking Two of the potential victims were male while 16 were female Most victims originated from the Philippines For comparison only six potential trafficking victims were identified in 2020 while 11 were identified in 2019 However total identifications in 2021 were still fewer than the 24 found in 2018 30 in 2017 and 35 in 2016 Immigration Approximately 830 undocumented migrants arrived in Malta in 2021 marking a significant decrease compared with 2300 in 2020 and 3100 in 2019 Migrants arriving to Malta are generally placed in one of the four government-run detention centres The report points to a new government policy which according to civil society prevented asylum-seekers from Bangladesh from obtaining a work permit for nine months in turn increasing their vulnerability to trafficking Additionally the US State Department said that the approximately 9000 refugees and 4000 asylum-seekers residing in Malta are vulnerable to trafficking in the country ’ s informal labour market including within the construction hospitality and domestic work sectors Trafficking profile In a more general profile of Malta ’ s trafficking situation the US state department identified that sex traffickers tend to exploit foreign national and Maltese women and children while labour traffickers exploit foreign men and women Labour trafficking victims largely originate from China Eastern Europe Central America and Southeast Asia with increasing numbers from the Philippines Several other women populations in Malta are highly vulnerable to trafficking These include women from Southeast Asia working as domestic workers foreign women working in massage parlours and women from Central and Eastern Europe Russia and Ukraine working in nightclubs,['Balzan'],"[(3351, 3357, 'LOC')]"

07:17,A racket involving second-hand Japanese cars with tampered mileage has left hundreds of consumers fuming and feeling deceived by the two dealers under the spotlight Since revealing the racket last Sunday MaltaToday has been inundated by customers who discovered that the low mileage on second-hand car sold to them was anything but “ I can ’ t believe they sold me a car which was much older than how it was actually advertised ” one customer who came forward told this newspaper “ It was my first car and I had to take a loan for it I ’ m shocked by what is being revealed ” EXCLUSIVE Hundreds cheated in racket involving tampered mileage on Japanese second-hand car imports Rokku Autodealer of Għaxaq and Tal-Qasab Autosales of Qormi are the car dealerships behind this racket but it remains to be seen whether others are also involved The tampering of mileage gauge is facilitated by lax controls when the cars are offloaded at the Grand Harbour and when dealers go to register the vehicles with Transport Malta In an exclusive report on Sunday MaltaToday revealed how hundreds of consumers were sold second-hand Japanese cars with tampered mileage gauges Rokku Autodealer is operated by Roderick Vella and Tal-Qasab Autosales is operated by brothers Chris Spiteri and Alex Spiteri Both have denied wrongdoing and have refrained from commentingHowever in initial comments to MaltaToday before referring the matter to his lawyer Vella blamed the story on other dealers who were trying to tarnish his name “ I don ’ t stand to benefit from such acts ” But despite his denials when contacted by customers over the mileage discrepancy Vella is telling them to go to his shop so that a solution can be reached MaltaToday is informed that some customers have returned their vehicle and have been given monetary compensation But this is not the case for all customers with some still in disbelief over the auto dealers ’ deceit A couple who wished to remain anonymous had each bought a Mazda Demio from Tal-Qasab but when comparing the original JEVIC certificate to the log book details they found a discrepancy of 51000km and 25000km respectively Another customer who reached out to this newspaper said he was sold a Toyota Regius van that was advertised at 98470km by Rokku Autodealer The JEVIC data base showed that in fact the truck actually had 266751km on it – a discrepancy of almost 170000km “ This is incredible ” he said letting out a string of expletives when he found out about the extent of the deceit One customer who was sold a Mazda Demio Skyactive by Rokku said she had bought the car at €10000 after it was advertised at 27000km In fact the JEVIC certificate showed a mileage of around 84000km “ It looked like a bargain but what am I supposed to do I will be speaking to my lawyer but if he sold hundreds of cars like this how can we expect any sort of compensation ” she said For his 19th birthday one customer who reached out to this newspaper had bought a Suzuki Swift from Rokku which was being advertised at 40000km When carrying out the verifications the JEVIC certificate showed an actual mileage of 118000km “ He screwed me over big time Let ’ s say he compensates me for the car what if I want to resell it Am I supposed to screw people over in the same way he screwed me ” he said “ They should be ashamed of themselves ” The list of customers who were duped by the racket goes on and as the days go by more people are facing the realisation that they were sold a car that was tampered with Victims of two car dealers who were sold vehicles with tampered mileage are being urged to contact the consumer authority with details of their case as numbers balloon The appeal was made by Consumer Protection Minister Julia Farrugia Portelli and the association representing used car importers Farrugia Portelli called on people who have found evidence of tampering on their Japanese-imported cars ’ odometer to file a complaint with the Consumer Affairs Authority Consumers can file an online complaint or call 8007 4400 Albert Fenech secretary-general of UVIA has told MaltaToday the association will be meeting all its members individually to ensure that their reputation remains untarnished “ UVIA also encourages any car owners with suspicions pursuant to what is being alleged in the media to verify their odometer readings and to speak to the authorities if any odometer tampering is suspected ” Fenech said The police are also investigating the matter and people have been urged to file a report on discrepancies in odometer readings at their nearest police station MaltaToday understands that more than 300 case files have been lifted by the police from Transport Malta however sources have said that none of the two alleged fraudsters have yet been questioned by the police The two suspect dealers are being represented by lawyer Franco Debono who in comments to MaltaToday said his clients were not releasing any statements at this stage Consumers can check for themselves whether the car they have been sold was tampered with by accessing the online JEVIC database where original details including mileage are listed before the car left Japan If the mileage listed in the database is higher than the mileage registered on the logbook at the moment of transfer to the customer than the vehicle was tampered

the rise but a growing community of thrift shoppers clothes swappers and sustainability activists is offering an alternative paradigm for Malta ’ s fashion scene Fashion Revolution Week a global campaign that brings together activists and fashion lovers to re-imagine a more sustainable fashion industry is led by the organisation Fashion Revolution which has local branches all over the world including in Malta Tamara Fenech set up the Maltese branch of Fashion Revolution in 2018 The group focuses on mobilisation through the consumer side of the supply chain Instead of feeding the ‘ fast fashion ’ industry the group promotes more sustainable consumer choices like buying clothes that last and repairing your own clothes instead of buying new pieces “ Sustainable fashion is multifaceted ” she said explaining that being sustainable in your consumer choices doesn ’ t have to break the bank either “ There ’ s second-hand clothes and you can repair your own clothes ” To celebrate Fashion Revolution Week the group set up a repair shop stand at the Earth Day Green Fair in Manikata Members set up an outdoor sewing station to repair damaged clothes for free helping people prolong the lifespan of their clothes Fenech explained that the event directly ties in with Fashion Revolution ’ s Made to Last campaign which promotes buying durable clothes with a long lifespan while giving new life to old clothes that are torn and need repairing “ Repairing is the first point of adding new life to your clothes Instead of chucking your old clothes away because they ’ ve been torn you can fall back in love with them ” she said ‘ Fast fashion ’ refers to a business model employed by fashion companies to mass-produce catwalk trends with low-quality materials and sell them at cheap prices Brands like Zara Primark and more recently Shein are among the most popular fast fashion retailers in the world today But fast fashion comes at a higher price Scandals have been emerging for decades on poor working conditions in the labour sweatshops used by these brands In 1996 one American magazine published a photograph of a young Pakistani boy sewing a Nike football together leaving the sports brand plagued with sweatshop and child labour allegations The industry also deals heavy environmental damage The UNDP estimates that the amount of clothes produced annually has doubled since the early 2000s with almost 100 billion pieces a year produced by 2014 A lot of the pieces end up in landfills as customers are constantly encouraged to buy more clothes to keep up with changing trends In opposition to fast fashion many girls over the world are instead adopting a ‘ slow fashion ’ approach to their wardrobe Fenech said she ’ s noticed a similar shift in Malta “ In the last few years second-hand clothes have definitely picked up There used to be a stigma around this but it has definitely changed especially among the younger generation ” she said This shift comes with entrepreneurial opportunity Francesca Falzon and Francesca Valletta set up their own thrift shop pop-up to resell their own clothes while raising money for animal charities What started as a one-off event ended up being a regular appointment with their fifth pop-up scheduled for 8th and 9th July “ For me and Fran sustainable fashion is a topic that truly sparks an interest and is something we really bonded over when we got to know each other ” Valletta recalled Preparations for their thrift events start months in advance when they begin promoting the event on social media From there the two start inviting local brands to sell their products at the event while scheduling dates to receive clothing donations “ All the clothes and accessories are donated by the public We use our social media platforms to reach out to people who are interested in donating their clothes and arrange a drop-off day prior to the thrift pop-up event ” Valletta explained Thrifting is a common way for people to reduce their environmental footprint when purchasing new clothes but Falzon sees more benefits beyond this “ It ’ s a different and fun way to go about your normal shopping and you end up finding pieces that are more original than what everyone else is currently wearing ” Falzon said The initiative has also grown over time More people are attending the pop-ups and donations have increased as well “ Both Fran and I have been taking it as a great experience to learn what works for our brand and how to make each event better ” Falzon said Thrifting has become more accessible in Malta with second-hand shops slowly sprouting across the islands Falzon said she feels this growing popularity is mostly down to the current Y2K style craze which play on the trends that characterised the late 90s and early noughties “ The majority of our shoppers are students so their budgets match better with thrift prices compared to current retail store prices ” she added Valletta added that heightened awareness on environmental issues has been a contributing factor too “ I think this has created some pressure amongst people to find sustainable alternatives and thrifting is one option ” Some manage to avoid spending a single cent by opting to swap their own old clothes in for second-hand pieces Towards the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic Cecilia Martinetto set up a Facebook group to facilitate this allowing people to swap clothes and everyday items through an informal barter system The idea came to her after she wanted to change up her wardrobe “ After four years living in Malta I wanted a change in wardrobe but living in a small penthouse studio apartment meant I didn ’ t know where to fit anymore clothes I decided to try and swap them thinking that someone would end up loving them ” she explained Swapping isn ’ t limited to just clothes Martinetto said that people have swapped gym members for beauty services and others have even tried to swap condoms and tampons “ Leftover food is also a common swap which I find amazing for fighting food waste ” she commented The group started informally but it has since grown intensely Martinetto said it is now run by a team of five people moderating the group “ With time we became more organised and introduced new rules such as the creation of an album for each member and a maximum of posts allowed to be published by a person per week ” One of the administrators is Kristina Felice Pace She said that the group still receives a lot of membership requests and posts to approve on a daily basis but COVID-19 meant that member meet-ups had to be put on hold “ If swapping were to become a mainstream phenomenon it would be remarkable however I think we still have a long way to go That being said through the past years I think that swapping has definitely become more popular since it is more accessible thanks to social media ” she said What sustainability means to them Falzon said that to her fashion sustainability means avoiding fast fashion while supporting local brands and ethically-made clothes “ My stance has been to have wardrobe basics that match your style which you can very easily thrift and create different outfits with them Trends change too quickly and I feel like it ’ s not only unsustainable for the environment but also for your wallet ” “ I shop from thrift shops vintage stores and hand-me-downs with absolutely no shame – as long as they ’ re comfortable and will serve their purpose ” Valletta thinks of fashion sustainability in three parts She said that it ’ s important for people to reflect on what needs to be done to mitigate issues stemming from unsustainable clothing consumption practices while remaining aware of the environmental problems of the overall fashion industry “ Lastly being able to engage in proactive and environmentally-friendly practices in terms of the way one consumes clothing This can be achieved through the long-term use of clothing thrifting buying less and so on ” Martinetto insisted that sustainability is the key to a better future “ Humans rely on natural resources for business activities and survival Ignoring sustainability can lead to the exhaustion of natural resources ” she said But ultimately sustainability for Martinetto comes down to the small changes that people can do to help care for the planet “ Making these changes helps protect animals plants and our natural resources so that future generations will be able to enjoy them ” Felice Pace an earth systems student herself put her thoughts on sustainability

06:40,When parliament opens in the coming weeks 79 MPs will take up their seats in the chamber the largest number ever But this is not the only record attached to the new legislature after an election that delivered 34 new faces more women and the youngest MP in history MaltaToday takes a look at the composition of parliament which sees the Labour Party enjoy a nine-seat majority over the Opposition Nationalist Party – two more seats than the last legislature Parliament XL Largest parliament ever With 79 MPs the new legislature will have the largest parliament ever The general election delivered the customary 65 seats which increased by a further two after the PN was awarded the extra seats to restore proportionality between votes obtained and parliamentary representation But with the new gender corrective mechanism kicking in for the first time the number of seats had to increase by a further 12 – six on each side The gender mechanism awards extra seats to redress any imbalance in gender but these are capped at 12 Given the shortage of women MPs elected on their own steam or through the casual elections the mechanism had to be used to the full this year With 79 MPs taking up a seat in the House the issue created a logistical problem because there are only 77 seats in the chamber designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano Speaker Anglu Farrugia has gone on record saying the issue will be fixed before the first session of parliament But the sheer number of MPs has also increased Malta ’ s density of MPs when compared to the size of the population With the latest census putting the size of Malta ’ s population at 516000 the country now has an MP for every 6500 people On a per capita basis Malta has the highest ratio of MPs in the EU with Luxembourg coming in second with a representative for every 10600 people Luxembourg ’ s parliament is made up of 60 deputies At the other end of the spectrum Spain has an MP for every 134000 people Women boost Highest ever female ratio The new parliament will have 22 female MPs the largest number ever Women now make up 28 a significant increase over the ratio of the past seven decades The ordinary election process saw 10 women getting elected on their own steam or through a casual election on districts where dual-candidacy MPs vacated their seat However the number was boosted by a further 12 MPs through the gender corrective mechanism introduced last year and which kicked in for the first time in this election The mechanism has been criticised as unfair by some because of the post-election adjustment in seats But when the reform was unveiled it was construed as a way to challenge more than seven decades of status quo and jump start the system so that immediate benefits could be reaped Throughout Malta ’ s history only 26 women were ever elected to parliament and until the 2017 election female representation remained stuck at around 14 The reform aspired to achieve a critical mass of 33 as quickly as possible and eventually a balance of at least 40 representation for both sexes And the mechanism also has a sunset clause which means it will expire after 20 years The 2022 election has come close to achieving critical mass giving a number of women – most of who contested the election for the first time – a platform to be in a better position to fight an election in five years ’ time 18 and a licence to legislate Youngest MP ever Nationalist MP Eve Borg Bonello is the youngest ever person at 18 to be elected to parliament in Malta ’ s history Indeed she could even be the youngest MP in the world Borg Bonello was elected to the House through the gender mechanism This was also her first election having made a name for herself at the age of 16 when she passionately addressed a gathering in remembrance of Daphne Caruana Galizia The youngest MP to be elected before now was Josie Muscat who was 22 when he first made it to parliament on a Nationalist ticket in 1966 Borg Bonello ’ s election to parliament comes at a time when the voting age for general elections was reduced to 16 However 16 and 17-year olds can not contest elections themselves something Prime Minister Robert Abela has suggested should be changed New faces A fresh look In a parliament of 79 MPs 34 have never been members of the House The wave of new faces makes up 43 of parliament ’ s composition Each of the two parties has 17 MPs for whom this is their first experience as legislators Renewal was more far reaching within the PN where 49 of MPs are new faces This election has served to fuel a generational change within the Opposition that has long been felt necessary Within the PL the ratio of new faces is 39 But the PL has another four MPs with a very short parliamentary experience having been co-opted in the period between 2020 and 2022 – Clyde Caruana Miriam Dalli Jonathan Attard and Andy Ellul The sheer number of new faces making it to parliament is probably one of the biggest acts

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/election-2022/116090/did_gender_quotas_election_punish_women_candidates,Did gender quotas election punish women candidates?,06/04/2022 07:49,Just four women were elected during the 2022 general election – a disappointing result considering the push for more female representation in parliament had been a major talking point over the last five years While parliament will end up with at least 20 women due to the casual elections and the implementation of the gender corrective mechanism which take place next week questions have surfaced as to why the result was in fact worse than 2017 which had seen eight women MPs elected Analysing the 2022 results University of Malta pro-rector Prof Carmen Sammut – who was part of the team that drafted the gender quotas law – said that she had expected the results as a number of established women on both sides did not run Notably prominent faces from both the Labour and PN did not run in the 2022 general elections such as Helena Dalli Therese Comodini Cachia Kristy Debono Marthese Portelli Marlene Farrugia and Justyne Caruana all of which were elected on their own steam back in 2017 Prof Sammut said this could have been a contributing factor to the poor showing of women candidates as many of these established figures who the electorate had voted for were not on the ballot “ However not all is lost as casual elections should see more women elected to parliament as well as the gender corrective mechanism “ After looking at the women who have already been elected we begin to look at the percentage of quota they have earned in each district and make a list Those with the highest percentage of the quota will be eligible to take a seat in parliament “ The mere fact that there will be enough women to participate in parliamentary committees is already great progress for me Before you would have situations such as the parliamentary health committee where they would be discussing issues such as IVF the morning after and other things and there would be not a single woman at the table ” she explained Recently-elected minister Miriam Dalli said that while at first glance it would appear very few women made it through straight away the casual elections must take place before a comparison with the 2017 elections can truly be made “ A deeper analysis shows that the women who contested on the PL ticket obtained almost 20000 first-count votes which compares very well with the 14000 first preferences obtained by women PL candidates in 2017 ” Dalli said Dalli said this showed that the number of PL voters whose first preference was a female candidate had actually gone up by 43 “ This despite the fact that 12 out of our 16 female candidates contested the general elections for the very first time ” Dalli who will now be heading the energy and environment portfolio and a €700 million urban parks project said that although only four female candidates made it past the post – Dalli incumbent Julia Farrugia Portelli and Bormla mayor Alison Zerafa Civelli from Labour and Graziella Galea from the PN – it was worth noting that three other female candidates achieved very solid results with first count preferences exceeding 1000 votes “ We knew from day one that things were not going to change overnight As we wait for the casual elections the culture change that we have been pushing for to see more women in leadership positions has started to bear fruit as more voters are choosing to vote for women ” Dalli said the gender mechanism was one of the tools that will help strengthen representation in the highest institution of our country by giving visibility to capable women who will have the opportunity to work and deliver However not everyone shares the minister ’ s optimism that the gender corrective mechanism is the way forward PN candidate and former deputy Speaker Claudette Buttigieg who failed to be re-elected this time around said the gender mechanism could be one of the reasons why more women weren ’ t elected Buttigieg who will herself avail of the gender mechanism to get into parliament this time around said that while she voted in favour of the mechanism she had warned that this scenario was likely to hapen if the right precautions weren ’ t put into place “ One problem we may face with this mechanism is that people will think that they do not need to vote for women as they will be elected with this mechanism Our aim should be that we do not make use of this mechanism despite it being there and that is when we can say that we have made it The mechanism is there in the chance we fail ” Buttigieg had said during a speech in parliament in January 2021 “ I don ’ t want to stand here and say I told you so ” she now told MaltaToday “ But what I feared would happen has come to fruition We needed a national campaign to tell people to vote for women and explain the mechanism properly ” Buttigieg also highlighted that there were not enough women contesting on either side – the PN had 17 women candidates while Labour had 16 “ What would have been more effective was to put into place laws to force parties to have a certain number of female candidates ” Buttigieg said Buttigieg argued that from what she saw from the PN ’ s numbers voters were giving women candidates the last choice which she attributed to the fact that the gender mechanism was not explained well “ A silver lining that the PN should elect more women could make it through the casual elections Janice Chetcuti Rebekah Cilia and even Graziella Attard Previ are up for a chance ” she said However Buttigieg said that doesn ’ t change the fact that because of the poor showing of women candidates Malta ’ s cabinet is once again lacking representation Out of Prime Minister Robert Abela ’ s 18-person cabinet of ministers only two are women Miriam Dalli and Julia Farrugia Portelli Newly-elected MP Alison Zerafa Civelli was also made a parliamentary secretary At the same time the PM has also said that after the gender mechanism two more women will be appointed to the executive Buttigieg also said that more needed to be done to help women get into politics such as making parliament full time “ I wouldn ’ t make it obligatory as I understand that is not the ideal situation for everyone however it would help more women be able to enter politics as it being part-time is a much bigger hindrance for women than it is for men ” she said Women ’ s Rights Foundation director Lara Dimitrijevic also one of the co-writers of the gender quotas law said that she believed that not enough was done by political parties to entice and attract women “ During the snapshot campaign women were little to be seen The mode of campaigning has today become very costly While a vegetable truck and a corner meeting worked well in the past today there is heavy competition to organise expensive and costly events ” she said Dimitrijevic said that women continued to be disadvantaged in this aspect which further showed that effort and support has to come from the political parties Another issue Dimitrijevic pointed out was the hate that women in politics continue to receive “ It is no easy feat to constantly be exposed to criticism and even worse hate and degrading comments ” she said “ This is the first election we have had with the mechanism which will certainly make more women visible in parliament However this can not stop here unless all family-friendly measures are introduced If done correctly and properly then one can truly comment on whether such mechanism has succeeded ” Dimitrijevic said Dimitrijevic said that more needed to be done to address gender disparity in politics “ apart from the introduction of family-friendly measures a parties commitment to attract and support women there also needs to be awareness-raising on the importance of having women in politics

citizenship-by-investment programme formerly the Individual Investor Programme IIP said applications for the golden passport had been on a downward trend before the pandemic “ The months-long closure of Malta ’ s International Airport and Seaport for passenger traffic as well as other airports and seaports world-wide likewise affecting passenger traffic practically brought the finalisation of applications to a standstill and the granting of citizenship to many of the successful applicants postponed sine die ” the ORGCES Office of the Regulator for the Grant of Citizenship for Exceptional Services said In the report covering July 2019 to December 2020 the regulator complained about the heavy criticism towards the IIP by national and international institutions who “ to date failed to get in touch with my office to witness how we meticulously scrutinise to the minutest detail the work performed by the Malta Individual Investor Programme Agency ” 340 applications were processed by the regulator a watchdog that scrutinises the operations of the Community Malta agency which had a 60 success rate 101 applications were refused while 32 were withdrawn either due to a request by the applicant or due to inactivity For 2020 alone the former IIP agency received 317 applications September saw the highest number of applications passing through the agency with 56 individual applications December was the slowest month with only 11 submitted application Since 2015 the agency has received 2222 applications The highest number of applications received in a year was 484 in 2015 The lowest number recorded was in 2018 with 286 applications Applicants are predominantly male with 75 of the applications representing a male main applicant Only 25 had female main applicants Over half of applicants come from Europe and Asia In 2020 European applicants made up 36 of all applications while Asian applicants comprised 37 of the pool Applications from the Middle East and Gulf region have fallen drastically over the years In 2015 applicants from this region comprised 20 of the total requests By 2020 they make up only 6 of applicants – the fourth lowest before South America 2 Oceania 05 and the Caribbean 0 For 927 of applicants their Maltese passport would have been their second source of citizenship after that of their birth country Meanwhile 7 of applicants already had two previous citizenships when applying while 03 had three previous citizenships In 2020 the majority of rejected or withdrawn applications came from Asia with 40 total applications This was followed by 33 rejected applications from Europe The rest of the applications hailed from Africa 9 North America 8 Middle East and Gulf 11 and one each from South America and the Caribbean There are 62 different agents that process applications presented to the agency but over half of the applications were submitted by only four agents The remaining 48 were distributed among 58 agents of which 27 only submitted one application during the 18-month covering period One of the main obligations of IIP applicants is to purchase or lease a property in Malta The property must have a minimum value of €350000 or if leased must have a minimum annual rent of €16000 94 of applicants chose to rent property – often-times in Sliema or St Julian ’ s On average the annual rent paid by applicants was €18591 Another obligation by applicants is to contribute to the National Development and Social Fund among a raft of other donations and investments For July 2019 and December 2020 applicants contributed €86 million to the NDSF and €107 million to the Consolidated Fund Another €10 million were distributed to Community Malta and almost €9 million was handed to the programme ’ s concessionaire Henley Partners Most applicants held back on their civil society donations but some proved to be very generous The University of Malta ’ s maths department received €108000 across just two donations Dar tal-Providenza received €159800 across 32 donations The Puttinu Cares children ’ s care charity received the most donations raking in €13 million from 210 donations The Malta Community Chest Fund received €11 million across 158 donations Scandal investigations In 2019 the law firm Chetcuti Cauchi Advocates was secretly recorded by a French TV news programme allegedly boasting of his friendly relations with the prime minister and parliamentary secretary for citizenship in a pitch to sell Maltese passports to potential African clients The footage had been heavily edited as was revealed after the company obtained the raw footage in a French privacy watchdog request The regulator investigated the allegations through a series of vetting sessions saying no red flags were uncovered to support the story “ No records were found of applicants having a criminal record or of applications being presented for the minister ’ s consideration more than once There was no indication of collusion between the agent and the responsible minister or with the agency for that matter nor was there any indication that the agent had ever received preferential treatment ” The regulator simply put forward recommendations to government to improve the citizenship process In July 2020 Opposition MP Karol Aquilina alleged that 58 applicants were granted citizenship without providing their birth certificate The regulator investigated and found that birth certificates may not be available in around 16 of countries in which case the agency would request other official documentation,['Sliema'],"[(3315, 3321, 'LOC')]"

Limited won a €12000 direct order in 2018 for the provision of self-drive cars to the Ministry for Transport In 2020 the same company also won four direct orders from the Rabat local council for the leasing of a Peugeot vehicle amounting to around €1000 in total Princess Operations won a tender issued in July 2020 for the lease of 38 low emission motor vehicles a crew-cargo van and two self-drive vans with Transport Malta The offer of Princess Operations had been the cheapest but the runner-up tenderer still went to court claiming irregularities in the bidding process In the appeal Davico Limited raised doubts on whether Princess Operations could really take into account all the real costs of full insurance cover as requested in the tender and claimed it did not possess the required number of vehicles The appeal was rejected by a court in January On Friday Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi claimed Transport Malta had returned the leased cars to Borg ’ s company MaltaToday sent questions to Transport Malta to confirm the veracity of these claims but did not receive a confirmation of whether the cars were returned “ DOC Tender CT21992020 was evaluated as per Public Procurement regulations and procedures The tender was challenged in front of the Public Contracts Review Tribunal as well as at the Apeals Court and both cases were judges in favour of the Authority for Transport The Authority will follow the established procedures ” TM said The tender on the government website however still shows that this tender was at an evaluation stage so it should not have been the case that the cars were already leased As part of the tendering process any bidding company has to declare that no person of the administrative body was ever subject to a criminal conviction Borg was at the time of the bid director of the company with Milton registered as company secretary According to the court documents the runner-up was informed by a letter on 18 June 2021 that Princess Operations had won the bid Yet in June 2021 Milton was charged with fraudulently obtaining 700000 from a car dealer and storing them in a crypto wallet Milton proceeded to resign his role as company secretary on 6 July 2021 although the Malta Business Registry document backdates the effective resignation to 16 June 2021 Borg on the other hand had minor convictions In 2015 he was found guilty of breaking car hire laws when changing the car registration plates from one car to the other and using unauthorised number plates In 2021 he was found guilty of perjury when offering false testimony in court It remains to be seen whether in light of Milton ’ s and Borg ’ s criminal records Princess Operations ’ bid should have been declared invalid Joseph Camenzuli has in recent days become the director of the company although Borg remains the sole shareholder through his other company Princess Holdings Limited Princess Operations had also won a tender SPD22021042 to lease 24 cars to the Local Enforcement System Agency LESA The tender had been issued on 22 September 2021 and awarded on 18 January 2022 a week before Borg was arraigned on the Rabat abduction incident MaltaToday sent questions to LESA to confirm whether the tender is in the process of being revoked “ The said tender was issued as per normal procedure and in line with the applicable legislation The process has been fully completed including any period of appeal being exhausted The said tender was evaluated in line with the Procurement regulations and with the necessary vetting and approvals as stipulated by the Department of Contracts LESA shall comply to any orders issued by the department of contracts or the courts ” LESA said Attempts to reach Joe Camenzuli on his cell phone and home address proved

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/115056/robert_2022_a_repeat_of_gonzipn_or_eddie_fiduja,Robert 2022: a repeat of ‘GonziPN’ or ‘Eddie Fiduċja’,20/02/2022 11:33,Polls in the run-up of the 2008 election were giving the Labour Party a slim victory over the Nationalist Party But then PN leader Lawrence Gonzi was miles ahead of his rival Alfred Sant in the trust barometer Faced with this dilemma PN strategists decided to pin their party ’ s hopes of victory solely on Gonzi ’ s higher trust rating among the population The 2008 PN election slogan GonziPN was thus born It meant to convey a message of hope urging the electorate to vote for the man they trust most – Lawrence Gonzi The campaign worked and the PN went on to win that election by a whisker It was the first time in decades that the party that was propelled into government did so on the strength of a relative majority and not an absolute one Fast forward 14 years and the Labour Party appears to be emulating that rallying call When we descended on the Granaries at Floriana where Robert Abela held his traditional Sunday speech we were greeted by never seen before posters ‘ Robert 2022 ’ The personalisation of the PL campaign attempts to hook up with its leader ’ s high trust rating among the electorate Whether this will be the running theme for an eventual election campaign still has to be seen but the fact that these posters were rolled out on the day in which Abela announced a 26 March election is a strong indication that the PL will pin its hopes on the leader ’ s trust rating Really and truly ‘ pin its hopes ’ may be an understatement Several surveys over the course of five years have been suggesting a clear victory for the PL with the only big question mark being the size of the gap with the PN So it begs the question as to why the PL would adopt a personalised campaign focussed on its leader when there appears to be no urgent reason for this The circumstances today for the PL government are not what they were in 2008 for the PN government 1 Putting the Muscat legacy to bed Robert Abela became prime minister in January 2020 on the back of political turmoil that saw his predecessor Joseph Muscat resign amid suggestions that people in his administration were close to Daphne Caruana Galizia murder suspect Yorgen Fenech With his leadership born in such controversial circumstances Abela has been trying to put distance between himself and the Muscat legacy which although has a lot of positives is tarnished by the Caruana Galizia murder and its ramifications on bad governance and corruption Abela has axed people tainted with scandal drafted in new faces enacted bold new laws and tried to craft himself as closer to the downtrodden Crucially he has played a very delicate balancing act in keeping Muscat and his controversies at arm ’ s length while keeping his grass roots supporters on board Muscat is still loved within the party – his utterances on social media still have a wide audience – since he represents the PL ’ s victorious streak that started the moment he was elected leader in 2008 Abela wants to craft his own niche be seen as a leader in his own right and thus put Muscat ’ s legacy to bed by securing a comfortable PL victory at the polls of his own ‘ Robert 2022 ’ is an attempt to personalise the PL campaign around the prime minister ’ s figure so that when the election is done and dusted Abela can say ‘ he ’ won it for the party In a way it is taking a leaf out of the PN playbook The most recent was GonziPN in 2008 when the leader ’ s popularity was used to propel the party to victory But election pundits will also remember the ‘ Eddie Fiduċja ’ billboards from the 1992 election when the PN had secured a 13000-vote majority paving the way for one of the largest electoral victories until then The PL strategists will be hoping that ‘ Robert 2022 ’ will deliver another big win that could possibly eclipse Muscat ’ s super majorities and in this way Abela ’ s legacy will be forged in victory Such a strategy may benefit Abela but risks destabilising the party as happened to the PN in the years after GonziPN 2 Taking the personal criticism head-on One other reason for adopting ‘ Robert 2022 ’ is to confront head-on the personal criticism of Abela ’ s lifestyle and wealth that has been directed towards him by the PN Since last September PN leader Bernard Grech has hit out at Abela ’ s rich lifestyle his comfortable upbringing and boating jaunts trying to picture the prime minister as a spoilt rich kid who can not understand the concerns of ordinary people The campaign intensified at the turn of the year when the PN came out with billboards contrasting the income Abela ’ s legal firm had from the Planning Authority - €17000 per month – with the meagre cost of living increase people received in January A more recent twist was the link between Abela and car dealer Christian Borg who was recently charged with abducting a man Abela had served as Borg ’ s legal advisor and was also involved in a property deal with him Abela has denied any wrongdoing from the time before he became prime minister Although these stories do not appear to have hurt Abela ’ s poll numbers they could get people thinking especially at a time when the cost of living is leaving an impact on the pockets of families and pensioners ‘ Robert 2022 ’ will be an attempt to show that Abela will not shy away from confronting the criticism being levied towards him He will want to show that ‘ Robert ’ is close to the people and in a balancing act with ‘ Team Malta ’ will ask voters to trust him and his team to lead the country forward 3 The winning card The PL may also want to capitalise to the maximum on Abela ’ s very strong trust ratings that have consistently put him ahead of his party ’ s popularity ‘ Robert 2022 ’ capitalises on Abela ’ s trust ratings that give the PL growth potential as opposed to the PN which has seen all its leaders after Gonzi consistently faring worse than the party Abela will want to take the battle directly to his opponent Bernard Grech The core question the PL will ask voters is who they prefer going up the stairs of Castille Robert or Bernard This strategy will attempt to draw a distinction between the PL ’ s new faces drafted in by Abela over the past two years and the PN ’ s old faces that still remember the Gonzi era led by Grech At this level the PL knows that it has a big advantage over the Opposition hounded by its fractured recent past ‘ Robert 2022 ’ tries to endear voters to the man who aspires to lead a team to another big victory and take the country forward But crucially it will also remind unsure voters of the alternative – Bernard Grech and his disparate band How unsure voters will respond is another matter altogether but ‘ Robert 2022 ’ will definitely start at an advantage,['Floriana'],"[(870, 878, 'LOC')]"

'status quo'",19/02/2022 09:58,Coordinator at Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar Astrid Vella has called it quits at the Intelligent Planning Consultative Forum IPCF claiming the committee was only appointed to keep the status quo “ It is well known that when politicians want to appear to be doing something about an issue where they would prefer to maintain the status quo they appoint a committee and obfuscate Such is the so-called Intelligent Planning Consultative Forum IPCF ” FAA said in a statement FAA said that the eNGOs appointed to the Forum insisted on prioritising the most damaging planning issues but they were instructed focus on non-essential issues such as green walls “ In 2021 the IPCF was supposed to be dealing with planning issues but hardly met at all Meanwhile untold and permanent damage is being done due to the authorities ’ adamant refusal to review the increase in building heights surreptitiously slipped into Design Guidelines 2014 Annex 2 ” It said that the “ manipulated ” building heights are destroying streetscapes all over Malta and Gozo and ruining the settings of heritage buildings FAA cited the scheduled Fgura Razzett l-Antik the Xewkija heritage house and the scheduled Barracuda Restaurant as examples of how Malta ’ s architectural history and cultural identity are being wiped out “ While the Minister for the Environment is not supposed to interfere in the planning process it is his responsibility to ensure that policies and regulation are respected ” FAA added that permits are being issued in violation of the Structure Plan Local Plans SPED DC 15 and UNESCO Guidelines for World Heritage Sites like ITS Pembroke the MIDI project at Manoel Island the hotels in Sliema 's residential area the high blocks in Xlendi the “ massive ” projects in Qala Sannat Nadur and the hotel development under Mdina bastions “ In granting such permits the authorities clearly demonstrate they do not care about the quality of life in our communities or the health of residents who are being engulfed by over-development and choked by Malta 's ever-increasing rates of vehicle emissions ” “ High buildings trap pollution in narrow roads and widening roads takes precedence over improving public transport providing safe pavements and bicycle lanes The silence from authorities over the 247 fumes emitted at Palumbo Dock which engulf the whole of Senglea illustrate the lack of concern for residents ’ health ” FAA said It called unacceptable Minister Aaron Farrugia ’ s attitude that NGOs have the option to appeal abusive permits “ Why should NGOs and local councils spend all their financial and time resources to counter the Planning Authority 's dereliction of duty Minister Aaron Farrugia 's 2020 announcement of a review of the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development SPED has still not materialised two years later ” FAA stated that the Environment Resources Authority ’ s readiness to waive Environment Impact Assessments EIAs has accommodated destructive road projects destroying trees and ecology while roadside trees and urban gardens essential lungs remain unprotected and are destroyed “ The almost complete scaling down of enforcement action along with the risible fines has created a climate of impunity enjoyed by powerful cowboy developers at the costs of the Maltese public and its heritage in violation of our laws and Constitution ” It said that NGOs and public are treated with “ arrogance and disrespect ” in the boards where the more harmful applications are decided FAA criticised the system of online meetings which it said is heavily weighed in favour of developers “ Similarly the authorities ignore NGO demands that developers are to finance infrastructural works required by their grand developments This burden on taxpayers is a gift to developers amounting to state aid to the construction sector ” According to FAA EU laws on energy efficiency in buildings to ensure sustainable construction are not being imposed undermining Malta ’ s chances of attaining its EU Climate Change commitments It said Malta and especially Gozo ’ s urban and rural environments have deteriorated exponential with towns becoming more chaotic and quality of life deteriorating while high buildings ruined the character and streetscapes of Malta 's towns and villages “ For these reasons Astrid Vella FAA ’ s representative has resigned from the IPCF as we can not continue to form part of an organisation that is essentially a sham to give credibility to the environmental authorities who are allowing certain developers to act with impunity destroying much of Malta and Gozo in the process ” FAA concluded,"['Fgura', 'Xewkija', 'Pembroke', 'Sliema', 'Qala', 'Sannat', 'Nadur',

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/environment/114979/protest_vindicated_how_zonqor_emboldened_communities_to_strike_back_and_win,Protest vindicated: How Zonqor emboldened communities to strike back and win,16/02/2022 11:28,Robert Abela ’ s announcement on TVM ’ s Xtra that the government will take back public land in Zonqor and Bormla granted to Sadeen group through a parliamentary resolution under his predecessor ’ s watch vindicates the demand made in Malta ’ s largest ever environmental protest held in June 2015 It was a time when Joseph Muscat was at the peak of his popularity yet unscathed by subsequent corruption scandals and right after a spring hunting referendum in which he played a decisive role in ensuring a victory for the hunting lobby It also followed a full-frontal attack on planning regulation which facilitated the property boom in subsequent years but which till then was met with weak resistance Muscat then banked on strong support in the south of Malta after decades of neglect contrasting the proposed American University to public infrastructure like the waste recycling plant in Marsaskala and the sewage treatment plant in Xgħajra both built under the PN In short the success of the national protest defied the prevailing political climate of the time to the extent that Muscat and his allies were surprised by the big turnout A harbinger of things to come The protest was set in motion after a public meeting organised by Moviment Graffitti immediately after Muscat announced the project in May which led to the formation of Front Harsien ODZ an ad hoc coalition of established NGOs left-wing radicals Marsaskala ’ s Labour deputy mayor Desiree Attard Nationalist councillor Charlot Cassar and former AD leader Michael Briguglio In another taste of things to come Labour MP Marlene Farrugia not only declared her opposition to the project but also opened up the meetings of parliament ’ s environmental committee which she presided to civil society activists Ironically by lashing out against these critics Labour pushed some of them straight into the PN ’ s orbit Yet while the protest movement followed an inclusive template with particular attention given to address Labour sensibilities the Nationalist Party then led by Simon Busuttil was desperately seeking a rallying cry organising its own poorly attended protest in May This played into Labour ’ s hands as the participation of the likes of former environment minister George Pullicino in Busuttil ’ s ‘ small ’ protest was used to discredit independent activists who were unfairly depicted as PN stooges Activists in a partisan minefield The PN ’ s militancy against the Jordanian business group Sadeen ’ s ‘ American University of Malta ’ project posed a dilemma for activists wary of the PN for its past misdeeds including a disastrous extension of building zones carried out nine years earlier but who were keen on a successful turnout for the protest To short-circuit the problem all political parties including Labour were invited to participate in the June protest in the knowledge that only the PN and Green Party Alternattiva Demokratika would participate The end result was a high turnout which emboldened civil society in the knowledge that it could mobilise thousands for a just cause Yet it also raised questions on whether the participation of politicians piggy-riding on popular protest ultimately weakened the legitimacy of such protests Still the successful turnout had an immediate impact as Muscat reacted by reducing the ODZ take-up in Zonqor from 90000 sqm to 18000 sqm by splitting the project in two allocating more public land in Cottonera But ODZ land in Zonqor as well as open spaces in Bormla like St Paul ’ s square were still ceded to a construction group with no prior experience in tertiary education And in the absence of any competitive tender in a marathon session of parliament in December 2015 It also paved the way for the controversial approval of a waterpolo pitch right in the middle of the Marsasakala bay displaced by the Sadeen project and recently revoked by the law courts after a successful crowd-funded campaign Emboldening activism The movement set in motion by the Zonqor protest emboldened civic activism on other environmental issues like the campaign against the DB project where Moviment Graffitti took a leading role in non-partisan campaigns which deliberately excluded official participation by political parties while still welcoming the participation of both PN and PL-led local councillors a successful strategy for which the turbulent Zonqor experience was a learning curve This led to successful campaigns like that against a policy allowing 3000sqm petrol stations on land outside development zones which was withdrawn in 2020 and the ongoing campaign against a marina in Marsaskala in which the local community is taking a more prominent role than in the Zonqor protest in a sign that local communities are becoming more independent-minded when confronted with threats to their collective wellbeing making it harder for Labour to depict environmental critics as PN stooges Unfortunately a similar inclusive movement which reaches out towards the Labour-leaning segment of the population was harder to replicate on politically-charged corruption issues Panamagate and the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia It was only in December 2019 that thousands answered the call of a plurality of civil society groups ranging from Graffitti to Repubblika to demand Joseph Muscat ’ s resignation Three years later another central piece of Muscat ’ s legacy is being scrapped by his successor While probably dictated by the economic feasibility of the project and its failure to attract the 3000 students promised by Muscat the decision gave Robert Abela the opportunity to give back to the public what was ceded to private interests by his predecessor In short without disowning Muscat Abela used this as another opportunity to distance himself from one of his predecessor ’ s pet projects It is also reminiscent of the Gonzi administration ’ s decision in 2007 to drop a proposed golf course in Għajn Tuffieħa which paved the way for the Majjistral Park in what was seen as a bid for redemption following the extension of building zones whose disastrous consequences are felt to this day It remains to be seen whether this decision heralds any reversal from the pro-development bias of this government The next test is whether Abela will withdraw a call for tenders for the development of a marina in Marsaskala But in the sequence of events leading to Abela ’ s latest decision the Żonqor protest stands out as the catalyst which emboldened local communities in discovering the power of protest and popular mobilisation,"['Marsaskala', 'Xgħajra', 'Marsaskala', 'Attard', 'Marsaskala', 'Marsaskala']","[(891, 901, 'LOC'), (936, 943, 'LOC'), (1416,

novel way to stymie the attempts by a business group that is claiming ownership of large swathes of land in Gozo due to its control of a 17th century noblewoman ’ s property foundation With homeowners in Qala and Nadur fearing they will lose the title to their homes the government has stepped in to dead-leg the Abbazia di Sant Antonio delli Navarra from registering the land in its name or challenge existing homeowners ’ titles The unprecedented move has come by way of a ‘ deregistration ’ that revokes all land registrations over a large area in Nadur including the titles of the 17th century Abbazia from the last two years The deregistration of the so-called Land Registration Area LRA was enacted by legal notice on Friday 11 February with the home affairs minister ‘ freezing ’ any form of registration just two years since Nadur and other Gozitan villages had been finally registered as LRAs The move comes two years since Prime Minister Robert Abela was petitioned by concerned residents in Gozo whose property titles were challenged by a business group composed of the redoubtable lawyer Carmelo Galea former magistrate Dennis Montebello and the Stagno Navarra family purported heirs of the noblewoman Cosmanna Navarra As shareholders in Carravan Ltd they control a 17th century foundation that long time ago arbitrarily swept up swathes of lands in Qala and Nadur Adding insult to injury for the residents in these villages is the Maltese Catholic archdiocese ’ s offhand decision to relinquish the control it previously had on the foundation to Carravan after a 30-year legal battle Today Carravan is challenging property titles of homeowners in Qala and Nadur with residents fighting their pretensions in expensive court cases But the legal notice now freezes these registrations bringing a stalemate to proceedings that for the time being stop Carravan from putting out the land for development as it did in Qala The legal notice could yet be challenged in the Maltese courts given that the LRA in Nadur registered in 2019 gave rise to property registrations that brought with them “ legitimate expectations ” of asset value LRAs are designated areas in Malta where an effective title to land must be registered by those who own it Notaries register property sales falling inside LRAs within two weeks whether they are a first-time or subsequent registration This also means that pretenders to a property ’ s title can challenge any registration by filing a caution against it After 10 years pass the first registration that title is converted into a guaranteed title – as long as no caution was filed against that title during that period Gozo land grab Cosmanna Navarra ’ s property foundation was created in 1675 claiming vast amounts of land in Gozo that were to be controlled by her first-born male descendants When the Navarra line ran out of first-born male descendants the Abbazia was placed under the control of a priest delegated by the Archbishop In 1992 Richard Stagno Navarra petitioned the courts to have him recognised as the Abbazia ’ s ‘ rector ’ after the Archbishop of the time refused to hand over the foundation to him Stagno Navarra obtained a controversial decree from Magistrate Carol Peralta – all in the space of 24 hours and without the Church being notified – to be made rector Stagno Navarra then used that decree to transfer the lands to Carravan a company owned by Montebello and Galea The Church protested and filed a case challenging the decision in 1992 which was finally resolved in 2013 in their favour But in 2017 Archbishop Charles Scicluna acquiesced to a request by Carravan to nominate its representative the lawyer Patrick Valentino as rector for a €200000 contribution to be used to fulfil the pious obligations laid down by Cosmanna Navarra in the Abbazia deed The Archbishop is of the opinion that Navarra ’ s foundation was founded for her heirs and that the Church ’ s control was necessary up until a descendant is able to take control of the foundation Still the process to relinquish control happened at breakneck speed First the Abbazia was deregistered from the Joint Office ’ s list of church properties – an office composed of government and Holy See delegates to administer the transfer of Church lands to the State The Maltese Church asked for the deletion of the Abbazia from the so-called Annex 8 But the Joint Office does not verify such requests “ We rest on their the Church ’ s word that ’ s what the Concordat says ” the office ’ s director Duncan Mifsud told the courts in one of the Gozo cases between Carravan and homeowners A second sore point are the claims of lineage by the Stagno Navarras which have never been verified No independent verification of the family tree presented by Richard Stagno Navarra back in 1992 has ever been carried out but the document itself was never attacked in any of the dozen court cases that have characterised the court saga Archbishop Charles Scicluna himself told the court in one of these cases that he made no verifications as to the claim of lineage But he said that since Carravan and the Stagno Navarras had guaranteed the legitimacy of their claim he could see no problem with their demands,"['Qala', 'Nadur', 'Nadur', 'Nadur', 'Qala', 'Nadur', 'Qala', 'Nadur', 'Qala', 'Nadur']","[(238, 242, 'LOC'), (247, 252, 'LOC'),

under two months after Borg 28 was summoned by the Tax Compliance Unit for an audit of his company Princess Holdings At that time Borg and Grech were running their car rental business and dealership but had not yet submitted a single set of their annual accounts for Princess Holdings and No Deposit Cars As the accounts filed in January 2022 show Princess Holdings amassed €22 million in accumulated losses despite Borg and Grech 26 flaunting their wealth on social media with snaps of their holidays and supercars Now they stand accused of having abducted a man whom they threatened to have his fingers cut MaltaToday has established that Borg Grech and Gaerty all travelled together from Malta to Las Vegas in October 2018The three tickets were booked together on the same reservation The three men were seated next to each other on the Air Malta flight from Malta to Frankfurt on 3 October According to a social media photo posted by Tyson Grech at the time he snapped a photo of the Skyscanner website with a pending selection for the flights Malta-Frankfurt-Las Vegas and back – priced at £3645 individually but at a total of £10934 or for three tickets A return ticket was booked for return on the 8 October The Nurmagomedov-McGregor fight took place on 7 October at 4am Another photo by Tyson Grech on social media shows Borg and him standing next to a Bentley they hired during their holiday The same car appears in a drone photo snapped by Grech and Borg seated in the back seat of the Bentley with Gaerty at the wheel The social media photo is tagged with the date 5 October 2018 Then on 7 October 2018 Tyson Grech is snapped next to the same Bentley Continental outside the MGM Grand right before the Nurmagomedov-McGregor fight In comments to MaltaToday Gaerty said he had paid for the trip event and accommodation for the MMA event “ along with a group of Maltese people who attended this event ” Having met Borg at a boxing event Gaerty however denied having a close friendship with Christian Borg “ I know Christian Borg as I know many other people including people in business I know many people but my decisions were never compromised in any way as I always stated publicly I always keep separate my personal life from my work and treat everyone the same when it comes to taking decisions I have always acted strictly in accordance with the law and department policy and procedures ” Gaerty told this newspaper Gaerty was also asked whether he saw it fit to investigate the tax affairs of Borg given that up until December 2021 the accounts for Princess Holdings had never been filed Now they are shown to have accumulated €22 million in losses “ As you know I can not provide any tax information due to confidentiality I can state that the department always took full action in cases where taxpayers are not compliant with the law In fact it is always up to the Tax Compliance department to initiate tax investigations that is to decide who to audit I never get involved as to who they decide to audit – there is a special unit which decides who to audit ” Gaerty told MaltaToday Gaerty also said that as Commissioner for Revenue it did not mean that he got involved or influenced the decisions taken by separate units within the department “ Those decisions are left entirely to the directors of the specific units In fact before I was appointed Commissioner there was a procedure whereby the Commissioner used to approve cases for investigations carried out by providing a delegation I immediately removed this procedure when I was appointed and left such decisions entirely in the hands of the unit head ” Gaerty stepped down in January after nearly 10 years in office and was replaced by Joseph Caruana the permanent secretary at Ian Borg ’ s transport ministry Gaerty took up an advisory role on fiscal policy matters within the finance ministry Shortcomings in the way tax crimes are uncovered were highlighted as one of the leading reasons Malta was last year placed on the so-called greylist of untrustworthy financial jurisdictions by the Financial Action Task Force FATF Gaerty had already been in the headlines in the past questioned by the police in 2020 as part of an investigation into trading in influence involving Yorgen Fenech who stands accused of conspiring to murder Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017 An investigation into a 2014 message exchange between Gaerty and Fenech was closed with no charges brought Princess Holdings The startling aspect of Christian Borg ’ s Princess Holdings one of his main companies is how it amassed €22 million in accumulated losses between 2016 and 2020The accounts seen by MaltaToday show an adverse audit opinion for a company which is entirely supported by Borg as shareholder and where assets are funded mainly by creditors Since 2016 revenue climbed from just €10000 to €988000 in 2019 and then €254000 in 2020 But the company ’ s expenses its cost of sales climb from €29 million in 2017 to €72 million in 2020The Princess Holdings accounts filed only with the regulator at the beginning of January 2022 reveal a company backed by interest-free loans from its shareholder – €36 million – and €26 million from creditors The accounts show that the company ’ s assets generate little revenue and that if creditors call in what they are owed there will be little to liquidate to pay them back The accounts also suggest that the company operates without a bank account resulting negative equity with losses year by year In the meantime Princess Holdings seems to have booked €4 million in receivable VAT for 2020 over and above €27 million in 2019 €14 million in 2018 and €695000 in 2017 Borg is also sole shareholder in Princess Construction which has €11 million in property acquisitions according to its accounts His other company No Deposit Cars Malta is also backed by shareholders loans of €88 million in 2020 with some €108 million in second-hand vehicles registered as inventory

13:02,Marsaskala local council presented a motion to Transport Minister Ian Borg and Transport Malta reiterating their position against the plans for a yacht marina at the Marsaskala creek In a press conference on Saturday in Marsaskala the minority leader of the Marsaskala council and PN candidate John Baptist Camilleri revealed how on 20 January 2022 the council discussed the issue of the yacht marina planned by Transport Malta with Borg “ In this meeting Minister Borg said that he was not aware of the Local Council ’ s August 2021 motion against the call for investors in a yacht marina in the bay of Marsaskala which also states that there should be no private concession for a yacht marina ” Camilleri said He said Borg acknowledged that the motion categorically rejects all plans for a yacht marina and proposed that the Council discuss the motion and by mid-February reconsider to allow for a motion that does not completely exclude concession of space to the private sector “ He pledged that Transport Malta would not move forward with the second phase of the process until the Local Council ’ s final position is made clear ” Camilleri said He said the council met again and unanimously agreed to uphold its August motion and formally sent notice of this to Minister Borg and Transport Malta The motion stated “ The Local Council is against the proposal for a yacht marina in Marsaskala presented in Transport Malta ’ s pre-qualification document and condemns its publication without consultation with the Marsaskala community The local council demands that this document be withdrawn immediately and that plans for a yacht marina in Marsaskala be abandoned completely Transport Malta should launch immediate discussions with the local council with residents of Marsaskala and with the local associations for the organisation of existing berths for the protection of the cultural and social customs of the locality the protection of the marine environment and for safeguarding the swimming zones of the bay ” Present for the press conference were a group of residents fishermen feast and fireworks enthusiasts and activists In a statement they said they believe the only remaining path for Borg and Transport Malta is that of withdrawing the call and plans for a yacht marina in Marsaskala They stated that Borg referred to the possibility that Transport Malta intervenes without private sector investment to repair the breakwaters and organise existing berths “ Since the publication of Transport Malta 's plans last August people have made it very clear that they do not want the privatization of Marsaskala Bay Residents and organisations have warned that Transport Malta 's plans for a bay consumed by pontoons yachts and expansive land reclamation will destroy marine life threaten the Natura 2000 site of il-Magħluq and destroy the cultural social and recreational activities which take place around the bay in the heart of Marsaskala “ Now that the Minister has asked that the Council give its final position before plans for a yacht marina proceed and the Council has upheld its first motion to categorically oppose these plans we believe all further plans for a yacht marina must be halted and the proposal withdrawn ” they stated David Spagnol from the fireworks group spoke of the importance of the ecology and the sea and said the marina would jeopardise them “ We require projects that improve the community My identity and community are all related to Marsaskala ” A fisherman Jason Genovese said that fishermen rely on the bay in order to make their living He said that with the marina they would not have any space to work and stated many fish would die “ I ask the minister are you listening to us It ’ s like we don ’ t exist We need to work and make a living ” Joanna Galea a resident said Marsaskala represents a break from the hustle and bustle of the island She stressed on the importance of the creek and the bay which she said are the “ cheapest form of stress relief ” “ Such serenity will be taken away by the marina I don ’ t want to sell my property I want to live here Nothing can replace the natural beauty of the bay ” Galea said Daniel Desira who spent his childhood in Marsaskala said the bay offers a break from the over development in the inner part of the locality He said the locality would not remain the same should the marina be built “ Politicians are always telling us that quality of life is not measured by economic development alone so why the marina I call on the Prime Minister to rethink and abandon the project ” Desira said The NGOs in support of the motion were Grupp tan-Nar Festa Sant'Anna Wied il-Għajn Grupp Armar Festa Sant ' Anna Wied il-Għajn Għaqda Baħħara Sajjieda u Dilettanti Wied

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/114824/central_link_leaves_attard_showroom_waterlogged,Central Link leaves Attard showroom waterlogged,09/02/2022 11:38,Faulty levelling and poorly-placed rainwater grills along a stretch of the Central Link road has been a cause for concern for an Attard businessman as puddles of water several inches deep keep accumulating outside his showroom during rain showers and heavy downpours The stretch of tarmac in question lies further up from the Harley Davidson showroom where hundreds of cars whizz through the newly-renovated street connecting Attard to Rabat During works on the Central Link project the road was resurfaced in such a way that the road dips to the side and forces water to accumulate near the pavement with nowhere for it to drain out There are two nearby rainwater grills One is placed around the corner to collect rainwater coming from the nearby bend while another is placed further down to catch some rainwater as it slides down the road Between the placement of the gutters and the levelling of the road a lot of the water coming from the Central Link project ends up sitting by the pavement until it drains naturally into the asphalt A local businessman who owns one of the nearby showrooms said that this problem first cropped up last year after works finished in the area of the Central Link project During one bout of heavy rainfall last October he noticed the rainwater collecting right outside his showroom with nowhere to go together with the rubbish carried in by the rainwater He realised that the rainwater has nowhere to go as both ends of the road in front of his showroom are at a higher level than the middle part near his entrance After taking some photos and videos of the incident he tried contacting Infrastructure Malta Transport Malta and the Ministry for Transport Infrastructure and Capital Projects to see if the issue can be rectified “ I have been bringing this problem to the attention of the authorities namely to Transport Malta and Infrastructure Malta from August but nothing was done to solve this issue ” Indeed the contractor carrying out the works along the road had warned the businessman that this issue would arise He pointed out that any rainwater falling along the area will have no way of finding itself into any of the nearby gutters Despite reaching out to authorities months ago any promises of a solution where never followed through “ I have never received any sort of notification from Infrastructure Malta even though the CEO Frederick Azzopardi was copied in each and every correspondence ” The pedestrian experience walking along the road is far from desirable As cars pass by and water accumulates both the showroom facade and any passers-by on the pavement would be showered by the dirty water on the road “ It was futile to explain to the authorities that when it rains it is practically impossible to walk on the pavement We can not even open our doors to customers and employees because of this situation ” he said “ This is negligence par excellence on behalf of Infrastructure Malta It is also an utter disgrace that no action has been taken for six whole months while Infrastructure Malta knows very well that they messed up the falls of the new road in this part but still they let things stand as they are One can imagine how I felt when with pomp they inaugurated the Central Link project last Sunday ” Central Link takes centre stage The Central Link Project was officially inaugurated last week with Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg and Prime Minister Robert Abela unveiling a monolith of a plaque in the middle of a pavement near the arterial road Residents and environmental activists were unhappy with the project when government first announced the works One protest in 2019 saw over 1000 people head to Attard to make their voice heard against the uprooting of trees and loss of agricultural land that the project would have caused Indeed in government ’ s first proposal authorities were set to remove all trees along one side of the road further up towards Rabat Floods of troubles Beyond this stretch of road Malta has long-standing issues with flooding after heavy bouts of rain Intense rainfall last November caused several major roads to flood including the bottom lanes on the newly-built Marsa junction In Burmarrad members of Malta ’ s armed forced had to carry out a helicopter rescue mission to pull out an elderly motorist and rescuers out of harms way after their car got stuck in flooded waters At the time Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg said the flooding was the mere result of freak weather never seen before and not the result of shortcomings by Infrastructure Malta There have also been other recorded instances of poorly placed rainwater gutters failing to collect any rainwater because of poor road levelling This was the case after a 2020 downpour where passers-by along a Rabat road noticed rainwater sliding down the street while completely missing the griddle meant to collect and drain the water out,"['Attard', 'Attard', 'Rabat', 'Attard', 'Rabat', 'Marsa', 'Rabat']","[(129,

the American company running three state hospitals is refusing to pay €365 million in unpaid taxes Court filings show Steward is challening the Inland Revenue Department bill after it was served with a notice to pay €365 million in outstanding VAT dues fines and other penalties The total amount of €368 million is owed for the period starting May 2016 to June 2021 and includes €329 million in tax owed €348 million in interest and €384000 in penalties In its court application Steward said its audit of the Vitals management accounts found “ serious anomalies ” with Vitals ’ original owners – the Bluestone network of offshore companies – having declared less output tax to claim more VAT credits in its favour when it actually owned money to the VAT department Steward said it was the hospitals ’ new management that approached the IRD to explain what it had found in terms of Vitals ’ dues on VAT Steward said the IRD was ready to negotiate the VAT bill with an agreement reached in July 2021 Yet an execution of this negotiated amount was never signed by the Tax Commissioner “ The tax statement is therefore surprising and unexpected considering the discussions that were taking place with the Tax Commissioner which resulted in a final yet unsigned agreement ” Steward ’ s lawyers said Steward will call in witnesses from the government and senior tax officials as part of its case The court case has temporarily paused separate legal action which the tax department planned on taking against Steward later this year after the company failed to pay taxes for four years Steward Healthcare runs Karin Grech St Luke ’ s and Gozo General hospitals as part of a multi-million deal it took over from the original concessionaires Vitals Global Healthcare VGH The Maltese government is currently in a stalemate in negotiations on the future of the maligned hospitals privatisation contract The Labour administration – despite voting in an additional multi-million budgetary spend on staff resources for the American company ’ s operations – is refusing an €80 million exit request for Steward Instead it is awaiting the outcome on a court case filed by Nationalist MP Adrian Delia the former Opposition leader calling for the rescission of the Steward concession With a magisterial inquiry into the original Vitals Global Healthcare concession now even embroiling former prime minister Joseph Muscat Steward officials could face the prospect of being dragged further into the ongoing investigation Steward is running three State hospitals Gozo Karin Grech and St Luke ’ s as part of the 2014 deal crafted by the Muscat administration with the unknown Vitals Global Healthcare to run the hospitals on behalf of the State The big mystery If nobody benefits why did Mizzi give Steward €100m exit penalty €100 million exit price Adrian Delia who as Opposition leader filed a case against the Maltese government as well as Steward Healthcare to request the rescission of the hospitals ’ privatisation thinks Steward ’ s endgame is a bid for a €100 million penalty secretly inked by former minister Konrad Mizzi in a 2019 side-letter MaltaToday revealed the existence of the side letter in March 2020 showing how the Maltese government was exposed to a hefty bill should the concession ever be rescinded The agreement was hammered out in August 2019 when Mizzi gave Steward an “ escape clause ” that turns any termination of its concession into a government default The wording was part of an agreement in which the government acknowledged a €28 million loan from Bank of Valletta to Steward as “ lender ’ s debt ” But the agreement laid down that should the hospitals ’ concession be terminated by a court of law – for whatever reason and even if Steward is in breach of contract – such an event would be a government default And that would mean that all debts incurred by Steward would be passed on to the government with the American company eligible for a €100 million contractual pay-out for its equity Government insiders baulked at the agreement claiming the loan facility and Mizzi ’ s commitment to Steward was unknown to Cabinet colleagues Apart from placing the hospital lands under Steward ’ s control as guarantees for the debt the agreement gave Steward unprecedented generosity by accepting that should the concession be rescinded by any law public order or decision judgement or decree – effectively any government or court decision – such an event will be “ a non-rectifiable government of Malta event or default ” Delia and ‘ fraud ’ admission Steward is also embroiled in another court case challenging a former Vitals Global Healthcare investor Ambrish Gupta of expectations of a €6 million payout But the concessionaire is claiming the original Vitals concession was obtained fraudulently Delia insists this admission means the hospitals privatisation contract has to be rescinded That would mean that a court decision upholding his request would also attack Steward ’ s claim for its €100 million payout Budgetary outlay to Steward Despite the negotiations between the Maltese government and Steward an additional €40 million was allocated to the health budget for Steward over and above €50 million first allocated to the company in last year ’ s 2021 Budget The health concession agreements for the Gozo and Karin Grech hospitals where the State pays Steward Healthcare for the labour resources that work at the state hospitals were in 2021 costed at €356 million and €136 million respectively These budgets have now been increased by €265 million and €139 million respectively The supplementary allocation brings the total payment advanced to Steward in 2021 to €89 million The financial vote was approved in the House on the same day a

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/114190/abelas_cooptions_widening_the_talent_pool_or_promoting_loyalists,Abela’s co-options: Widening the talent pool or promoting loyalists?,06/01/2022 08:00,When an MP resigns from parliament his or her replacement is normally found through a casual election in which district votes in the previous election are re-opened and the candidate inheriting most votes through the Single Transferable Vote system is elected But co-options which see the replacement handpicked by the party ’ s leadership are possible in three circumstances namely when the MP who resigned had been elected in a casual election when all possible replacements who previously contested the district have already been elected to parliament or are no longer eligible or when none of the candidates eligible to contest a casual election actually present their candidature to the electoral commission Giving up a life dream These legal provisions made co-options rare simply because few candidates would miss on their once-in-a-lifetime chance of becoming MPs Any candidate on the list even those with a minimal number of votes could thwart any attempt to avoid a casual election One clear-cut way of co-opting a new MP is when they are chosen to replace someone elected in a casual election For example Energy Minister Miriam Dalli found her way into parliament as a replacement for backbencher Etienne Grech who resigned inexplicably in what was widely interpreted as a shrewd move by Robert Abela to inject new blood in his government Jonathan Attard was also co-opted following Manuel Mallia ’ s appointment as British High Commissioner But party leaders can also exploit a significant ‘ loophole ’ by persuading all party candidates eligible to contest a particular seat not to present their candidature thus paving the way for a candidate handpicked by the party leadership Yet this depends on the willingness of all those involved cooperating with the leadership by giving up on a lifelong dream And it come at a cost for those who renounce a possible seat even expecting a reward for their loyalty This was the case in the election of Finance Minister Clyde Caruana who was co-opted to parliament after the only two eligible Labour candidates from the second district namely Stefan Buontempo and Mark Causon failed to submit their nomination in a casual election after the resignation of Joseph Muscat from MP It was also the case with Andy Ellul who was coopted after none of the five remaining Labour candidates from the third district including Marsaskala mayor Mario Calleja presented their candidature A mockery of democracy In the absence of the full cooperation of all candidates a co-option may still take place after the candidate who gets elected in the casual election immediately renounces his seat Yet this is where things can get messy For example Oliver Scicuna ’ s co-option in 2021 was only made possible after the immediate resignation of Gavin Gulia who was elected in a casual election forced on the party after its former Rabat mayor Charles Azzopardi later defected to the PN refusing to renounce his candidature in the casual election This made Gavin Gulia ’ s tenure one of the shortest ever in the history of the republic and one which made a mockery of the democratic process In this case the public outrage was only defused by the choice of a respectable candidate like Scicluna Yet this was not without precedent from the other side of the Rubicon Back in 2017 Adrian Delia ’ s path to parliament upon his election as party leader was only made possible by the resignation of close ally Jean Pierre Debono which triggered a casual election which resulted in the election of Peter Micallef who immediately gave up his seat to trigger Delia ’ s co-option Delia ’ s convoluted pathway to parliament was dictated by Marlene Farrugia ’ s Democratic Party ’ s stubborn refusal to withdraw its candidates who had contested on a joint PN-PD platform from contesting the casual election Widening the talent pool technocrats While co-options have been a rare but acceptable feature of democratic life in Maltese politics the co-option of five new Labour MPs under the tenure of Robert Abela as Prime Minister in the space of a two years has raised questions of democratic legitimacy simply because these MPs two of which are now serving ministers were not elected in a general election This has been interpreted as a way for Abela to create his own solid bloc of loyalists in a legislature inherited from his disgraced predecessor It also provided him with an opportunity to widen his limited talent pool with Clyde Caruana and Miriam Dalli injecting dynamism in his Cabinet and Oliver Scicluna bringing his experience in inclusion into the parliamentary group The risk is that candidates co-opted to parliament may be more accountable to the party leader who handpicked them then to voters Moreover they are being given an advantage over rival Labour candidates just weeks before a general election The systematic use of co-options also betrays Abela ’ s preference for a more presidential style of government evident in his recent invitation during a session of the youth parliament for a national discussion on whether prime ministers should be allowed to appoint technocrats to Cabinet even though they are not elected to parliament This kind of position had been previously privately entertained by Lawrence Gonzi who had complained of his limited talent pool in a leaked United States cable on a meeting with former US ambassador Molly Bordonaro Yet Abela is not inventing the wheel even if co-options were used more judiciously Eddie Fenech Adami and Alfred Sant were also co-opted Both Eddie Fenech Adami and Alfred Sant were initially co-opted to parliament after failing to get elected in previous elections It is hard to imagine the trajectory of their career had they not been handpicked by the party leadership to take a parliamentary seat Ironically Borg Olivier ’ s decision to co-opt Eddie Fenech Adami came back to haunt him as the young Birkirkara lawyer grew in stature to eventually replace him Before being co-opted Fenech Adami had unsuccessfully contested the 1962 and 1966 elections only to become MP in 1969 following a co-option for the seat of Ġorġ Caruana who had previously been elected in a casual election Labour prime minister Alfred Sant was also co-opted to parliament to fill a vacant seat upon the death of Labour MP Joseph P Sciberras Yet both Fenech Adami and Sant were already big shots in their party with the former already serving as president of the Administrative and General Councils assistant secretary-general and editor of PN organ Il-Poplu and the latter as Labour Party president Both became party leader after serving a number of years as MPs and both were re-elected on their own steam to parliament in elections in 1971 and in 1992 respectively This was not the case with other party leaders who were not sitting MPs upon their election as party leaders Muscat Delia Grech Making way for the new leader Joseph Muscat was also co-opted following his election as party leader after the 2008 election after Labour MP Joseph Cuschieri gave up his seat Yet Muscat was already a big shot in the party having been elected as an MEP in 2004 with 37000 first preference votes Muscat also remained in ‘ debt ’ with Cuschieri who was first fielded as an MEP candidate in 2009 having only taken his seat after Malta was awarded a sixth seat in 2011 and subsequently appointed ambassador to Greece despite lacking any experience in international diplomacy Both Adrian Delia and Bernard Grech two political outsiders with no constituency base were also co-opted to parliament after being elected by party members And while Delia ’ s path to parliament was messy thanks to internal party strife and the insubordination of the Democratic Party Grech ’ s path to parliament was more of a formality following the resignation of entrepreneur Ivan Bartolo who had himself been elected in a casual election Internal party strife also prevented Delia from rewarding Jean Pierre Debono for his sacrifice in vacating his seat His plan to co-opt Debono back to parliament after David Stellini ’ s resignation was thwarted by the party ’ s Gozo section ’ s insistence on the co-option of a Gozitan MP since Stellini himself had been elected in a casual election instead of Gozitan MP Marthese Portelli Ultimately the party opted for the co-option of Kevin Cutajar So what makes the use of co-options by Robert Abela any different from previous ones The legal mechanisms surely remain the same and Abela is not re-inventing the wheel The only difference is the systematic use of the mechanism in such a short timeframe dictated by the unprecedented circumstances which saw Abela struggling to leave his mark in an administration inherited from his larger-than-life but disgraced predecessor,"['Attard', 'Marsaskala', 'Rabat', 'Birkirkara']","[(1359, 1365, 'LOC'), (2368, 2378, 'LOC'), (2863, 2868, 'LOC'), (5893, 5903, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/113800/alevels_only_2_will_study_foreign_language,Expert sounds warning as Maltese teens shun Italian and French at A-level,15/12/2021 07:30,Malta ’ s education system is roundly criticised for its inability to invite youths to make critical assessments of their country Yet even in languages the Maltese student population is finding foreign language proficiency less alluring than before Of the 4797 students who completed their studies in one or more ‘ foreign ’ languages at secondary level in 2021 only 101 continued studying the language at Advanced level The shocking finding shows that practically 98 do not want to pursue knowledge of either Italian French or German after they leave secondary school at 15 Dr Mario Pace University of Malta senior lecturer in Italian called for an overhaul in post-secondary foreign language learning away from a one-size-fits-all model With just 101 students furthering their studies in a modern language apart from Maltese and English at A-level the figure of 2 has shocked those who previously took the Maltese aptitude for language-learning for granted In 2016 this number was at 189 A further 230 students are studying a foreign language at Intermediate level but it is only students who study a language at A-level who can continue their language studies at the University of Malta In his study “ Losing out on Foreign Languages Can we afford it ” Dr Mario Pace called for urgent action warning that Malta risks witnessing “ a diminishing supply of young home-grown linguists ” available to internationally-oriented businesses or as teachers who can train others Pace thinks such a scenario would “ in turn could create long-term difficulties for our country ” His study suggests that the progressive decline in students studying foreign languages at A or Intermediate level is more linked to the way these subjects are thought and packaged in the fields of specialisation on offer than with demand for these subjects He notes that while adult learners enrolling in foreign language courses in Lifelong Learning Centres LLCs is increasing – with their numbers reaching a staggering 1873 in 2019 just before the outbreak of the pandemic – this same success is nowhere to be seen among 16-year-olds starting post-secondary education Pace highlights the stark contrast between the increased interest in foreign languages among adults which reflects labour market realities and the decline of languages at “ post-compulsory and tertiary levels ” While recognising that schools are not the only venue where people can further their education in languages he points out that language learning and teaching will flourish “ if students are motivated by the provision of the right opportunities at post-compulsory level ” and if what is being learned in class is connected to the outside world and can be applied “ to real life ” Pace sad the “ one-size-fits-all ” model in language learning does not cater for that category of students which simply wants to “ improve their proficiency in the basic foreign language skills namely listening speaking reading ” Instead the only option available to these students is to follow an “ A ” level or Intermediate course as part of the MATSEC certificate which emphasises “ grammatical accuracy literature and culture rather than proficiency in the target language ” While underlining the “ undisputed value of literature ” one also has to cater for young people currently “ frustrated ” at the absence of foreign language proficiency FLP courses at post-secondary level with a special focus on “ listening speaking reading and writing ” So far the only exception to this was the introduction of a foreign language proficiency course offered at the Higher Secondary college in Naxxar and on a voluntary basis at MCAST and the University of Malta One way to address the situation could be the introduction of university courses which include combinations of foreign languages with other subjects Pace notes that in British universities eight out of every ten students are opting to combine a language with another subject And these combinations are not limited to the humanities and social sciences but also include business studies maths physics engineering or natural sciences The decline in Maltese students furthering their education in foreign languages at tertiary level is in marked contrast to the objectives set in the European Commission ’ s Lisbon Strategy which underlines the need to improve foreign language teaching at all levels of education throughout Europe And while various initiatives enticing more students to study foreign languages at secondary level have been implemented during the past few years Malta still lags behind when it comes at enticing students to do the same at tertiary level Pace argues that if Malta truly recognises the need that graduates and employees are also proficient in one or more foreign languages “ we need to move away from a one-size-fits-all system at post-secondary and tertiary institutions ” Concern at the low intake for courses in foreign languages at A-level was also expressed in the annual MATSEC reports The latest report noted that while the popularity of the two national languages is generally increasing as A-level options “ the opposite effect is noted in foreign language examinations ” And among those opting for the study area which includes languages one finds the largest gender disparity with 695 of candidates being female Statistics presented in Pace ’ s study show that Spanish was the most popular option among adult education learners who chose a foreign language course learners in Spanish represented 34 of the total number of students following adult education courses But at secondary-education level Italian remains the most popular choice followed by French German and Spanish Only 18 students opted for Arabic while five opted for

notice,30/11/2021 14:48,Malta ’ s director-general of law courts has been granted unfettered authority to erase court judgements from a public government website without any specific criteria laid down at law Despite no ‘ right to forget ’ law being implemented in Malta the justice ministry issued a legal notice that formally grants the CEO of the Court Services Agency to “ determine whether a person has valid grounds to exercise the right of erasure of personal data in respect of the content of a court judgment published online ” The right of erasure of personal data from a court judgmement shall be given effect either by anonymising the judgment or any part thereof or by removing the judgment from the website entirely The courts director now has the discretion in deciding upon an application for the exercise of the right of erasure of personal data from a court judgment published on the website of the Court Services Agency MaltaToday has previously protested personally with this pratice with both the former director-general of the courts and the former minister for justice The ‘ Right to be Forgotten ’ was enshrined in EU law in 2014 If requested this law dictates that search engines and other directories such as court judgements must delete any links to information on an individual as long as it is ‘ inaccurate inadequate irrelevant or excessive ’ This ‘ delisting ’ prevents material from being found through search engines like Google Erasing the right to know Maltese courts applying restrictive interpretation of privacy rules Dangerous precedent Critics of the ‘ right ’ include human resources firm Konnekt ’ s CEO Josef Said “ The price paid is the erosion of collective memory It is generally in the common interest for information to be freely available While some people might find their lives blighted by unfair online distortion many of those who request to be forgotten have something nefarious to hide I believe that I should be able to search for and find fraudsters crooked business people and criminals ” In 2018 MaltaToday obtained a list of 22 judgements removed from the online courts system in a freedom of information request Ever since a warranted lawyer had a conditional discharge removed from the online courts system it was revealed that former minister Owen Bonnici had granted the courts director discretion on requests for the removal of judgements The two students Yanica Barbara 28 of Attard and Thomas Sant 30 of Qormi were given conditional discharges in late 2009 and mid-2010 respectively after being found guilty of theft a few years back The Association of Judges and Magistrates said the two students had been “ conditionally discharged and at law such a decision is not a conviction ” which means the charge does not get included in a criminal record in Malta and nothing prevents the two graduates from being granted a warrant to practise law Barbara ’ s 2010 sentence was removed after the court ’ s DG accepted her request to strike off the judgement from the database The Malta IT Law Association has previously said that the removal of personal data from an online service administered by the government and which contains public records especially court judgments can not be simply compared to de-listing from a search engine “ Additionally the right to be forgotten is not an absolute right – data controllers such as the court ’ s director should take into consideration whether the public interest is served by deletion or not and the importance of the personal data being erased ” lawyer Antonio Ghio had told MaltaToday “ The application of public interest considerations restricting the right to be forgotten is stronger when the request for erasure of public data is not being made against a search engine or a newspaper but on the keeper of the public record ” The legal notice issued by justice minister Edward Zammit Lewis carries no rules policy or procedure publicly available that outlines the way someone exercises the right to be forgotten MITLA says complainants can not expect to be “ absolved ” from the truth of their past in all occasions especially when such availability of information is still relevant to the present and future whether as individuals or as society at large especially when one considers that position that certain people including public officers have “ Without specific rules the right to be forgotten can not be used as a blank cheque to re-write our personal history especially when crimes which affect the whole of society are involved If we start on this dangerous route will we continue to erase other more heinous crimes simply because it is not fair for one ’ s criminal history to follow one for the rest of one ’ s life Where would the fairness and justice in that be for the victims of that crime Where would that leave society at large ” Ghio asked,"['Attard', 'Qormi']","[(2418, 2424, 'LOC'), (2447, 2452, 'LOC')]"
https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/113442/analysis_an_early_christmas_how_abela_is_lowering_the_heat,[ANALYSIS] An early Christmas? How Abela is lowering the heat,25/11/2021 07:00,After weeks of intense pre-budget campaigning in what many interpreted as a sign of an imminent election Robert Abela has suddenly withdrawn from the fray The Prime Minister gave the public a break by stopping Sunday sermons in party clubs and refocusing debate on a cannabis reform Bill The move left the Opposition disoriented at a time when it was expecting a general election Abela ’ s back-seat approach has left it up to the Nationalist Party to keep up the momentum it needs to mount a credible challenge in the election which has to take place in the first half of 2022 But is this Abela ’ s way of neutering the Opposition or just a well-deserved Christmas break for a country fatigued by COVID-19 and politics As things stand it is the Opposition which needs to keep up the heat on government in its so-far elusive gamble to cut Labour ’ s insurmountable lead in the polls A de-escalation of political heat benefits the party in government which only needs to consolidate its lead in the surveys without taking unnecessary risks And while the Opposition needs to boost the morale of its demoralised troops Abela can bank on his supporters ’ enthusiasm galvanized by surveys Abela ’ s no-risk strategy To some extent this is not a new strategy Since being elected PL leader Abela has avoided any debate with the new Opposition leader Bernard Grech Abela had constantly denied Grech a shared platform which he desperately needs to build up his public persona and gravitas as an alternative prime minister By the time Abela would face Grech in face-to-face electoral debates most voters would have already made up their minds Moreover Abela has also not given interviews with the independent media avoiding uncomfortable questions on his relationship with his predecessor Abela has largely kept aloof of partisan confrontation benefitting from the inevitable exposure in his role as Prime Minister rather than as party leader And de-escalation comes with an added benefit for Labour it goes down well with middle-of-the-road voters turned off by constant electioneering and yearning for a serene and elongated Christmas season For the Opposition this represents another dilemma The Opposition can not afford to lower the heat on serious issues like the scandalous €100 million termination penalty in the hospitals deal with Steward but at the same time it can not afford to look like a divisive Grinch out of synch with a public yearning for a time out Festive cannabis Additionally the Opposition has little to gain from the controversy generated by the last major Bill being discussed in parliament before the Christmas recess - the cannabis reform Bill The controversy has only served to reinforce the PN ’ s detachment from its own liberal wing and unable to score points among conservatives because of Grech ’ s initial flirtation with the proposed law when he claimed credit for government ’ s inclusion of provisions for the sale of cannabis from non-profit clubs Labour is fighting on a favourable terrain – it appeals to social liberal young voters while at the same time exposing Grech ’ s contradictions to offset any collateral damage among its own socially conservative voters In its attempt to score any points among conservative voters the PN may well end up alienating its own liberals who recoil at the party ’ s reluctance to ‘ normalise ’ a lifestyle which they consider mainstream While Labour does risk being out of sync with a silent majority that sees cannabis legalisation a step too far it is more likely for people benefitting from the reform who will change their vote than people who are sceptical of it As happened on other issues like same sex adoptions ‘ culture wars ’ have been more damaging to the PN than to Labour whose conservative wing is dormant and loyal In contrast Labour has evaded controversy on environmental issues by postponing major decisions like the Marsaskala yacht marina and land reclamation to after the election in a bid to avoid damaging controversies in local communities The risk is that residents will wake up to these controversies in the first year of a renewed Labour government when the Opposition will probably still be reeling from a third consecutive defeat Abela ’ s millstone What remains problematic for Abela is the Muscat legacy and the persistent presence of Konrad Mizzi something which is very apparent from the ‘ neutrality ’ of Labour MPs in the public accounts committee quizzing Mizzi on the Electrogas contract Labour MPs have also been coy in ‘ reprimanding ’ fellow MP Rosianne Cutajar who was found guilty of an ethics breach The Standards Committee reprimand is without consequences for Cutajar Yet by keeping the spotlight on these issues it is the Opposition which has to be careful not to sound too divisive by engaging in shouting matches on an issue from which it rarely benefitted in electoral terms A major problem for the PN is how to keep interest in a series of scandals involving the people we have been hearing about for the past five years while not sounding like a broken record Within this context Abela still manages to perform an incredible acrobatic feat He gives the impression of change to voters who resent Muscat ’ s legacy while keeping loyalists on board Abela manages to do this by setting a safe distance between himself and his predecessor without actually reneging him The problem for Abela is that time is catching up with him and people are wondering why nobody has been arraigned on corruption cases involving past Labour ministers and officials like Konrad Mizzi While people are keen on switching off to enjoy an early Christmas possibly to compensate for last year ’ s missed festivities this period is also of crucial political importance being the time of the year when extended families and friends get together possibly also reinforcing perceptions on politics and the approaching election This is why it is important for parties to end the year on a positive note And this may be one more reason for Abela to avoid controversy and for Grech to try and leave a final mark Although even here Abela can afford to keep the PN guessing on whether a quick campaign awaits them in the winter months ahead or whether the electoral appointment will come in late spring,['Marsaskala'],"[(3907, 3917, 'LOC')]"

predominantly Catholic island the strides Malta has made in LGBT-friendly laws have truly changed the face of the country over the past 10 years This is primarily reflected through the island ’ s laws – in 2015 the practice of conversation therapy was ruled illegal with those who still practice facing significant fines and even a potential five-month jail term Under Maltese law neither sexual orientation nor gender identification can be classified as a disease disorder or shortcoming of any sort Additionally the age at which people can independently request for their gender to be changed in official documents was changed to 16 Then in 2017 Malta went one step further and legalised same-sex marriage The country ’ s IVF laws also reflect this notion of equality giving same-sex couples the ability to access IVF These are bold moves for a predominantly Catholic country that only began allowing divorce in 2011 and is the only member of the European Union that still considers abortion to be criminal office Nevertheless Malta is ranked number one in the ILGA-Europe ranking of all 49 countries in Europe on their respect for gay rights and equality However how does this translate when running for politics While Malta has put forward LBGT candidates it has only elected a handful of people such as Cyrus Engerer to posts such as MEP Notably Malta has yet to elect a transgender or non-binary person to office Kassandra Mallia sheher Kassandra Mallia is a candidate for the pan-European party Volt who will be contesting in the next general election Mallia said that while she always wanted to get into politics she only recently reached a place in her life where she felt comfortable stepping forward “ I ’ ve realised that to tackle the problems Malta faces I have to step up and be part of that change and not just sit on the sidelines and wait for someone else to do something for me ” Mallia said her party choice came down to the fact that she doesn ’ t have a high level of trust in either of the island ’ s two leading parties Labour or Nationalist “ We need something far better than choosing between the better of two marginally identical parties That ’ s why I chose Volt ” Mallia will be running in districts 9 and 11 A Mosta native she said that one of the things that spurred her to get into politics was the wish to help the locality she grew up in and that her parents have lived in since the 1980s Being a transgender candidate Mallia faces unique problems that her counterparts do not However the candidate said that the best way to approach people on the issue of gender and sexuality is to understand the confusion and seek to educate where possible “ A lot of people have always approached presentation and gender as being aligned So I understand that there is a big information gap On my own journey this is something that I myself had to learn about as well ” she said Nonetheless Mallia said that her policies and what she stands for should be at the forefront – while also being open to discussions on pronouns and gender when the conversation is brought up “ My policies and my personal identity are separate though that ’ s how I look at it ” Discussing the sometimes-toxic environment online Mallia says she tries not to worry about those who choose not to understand “ It doesn ’ t scare me I get that they ’ re either purposely trying to avoid solving issues or that they have a severe lack of information and understanding And that ’ s something I pity rather than would be angry about ” Alex Mangion hehim Alex Mangion is a candidate for the Nationalist Party and the deputy mayor of Attard He will be contesting the 11th district which he concedes will be difficult as there is stiff competition On running as a transgender candidate Mangion said that he never felt it was an issue despite being part of what many consider a conservative party He noted that more often than not people are willing to understand learn and listen Mangion said that having been in the political sphere since 2015 he has met many different people around Malta and never felt unwelcome Even within his own party Mangion said that while he has had to explain certain things to a few people he has never been shut out of the conversation or told to “ get lost ” When asked about how he tackles people who may not understand he said he always starts by explaining his point of view and experience “ Through explaining where I ’ m coming from I can help people see that there ’ s more that unites us than what makes us different ” he said The candidate said that he didn ’ t feel like there was a barrier between him and party members “ They are far more accepting than people think they are It ’ s a misconception that they aren ’ t ” Mina Jack Tolu theythem Mina Jack Tolu is a trans-feminist activist and candidate for ADPD the Green Party They will be contesting in districts 9 and 10 Tolu said they have a close connection with these districts having grown up in Pembroke “ It ’ s where I call home my mother grew up in Paceville back when there was still a community – that ’ s actually where my parents met ” Tolu said Tolu will be contesting with ADPD for the first time after AD and PD merged together in 2020 They previously were a candidate for the European elections in 2019 Tolu said that if anything the party has been stronger since the merger adding that there was a renewed sense of energy within for all those involved “ We have a lot of strong voices from people like myself and Sandra Gauci who focus more on social issues to others within the party who champion for classical green values Like most parties ADPD is a broad spectrum ” As a member of the LGBT community Tolu said they were delighted to see more members getting involved in politics “ One thing I want to get across is that we belong in politics and always have – myself I ’ ve never worried about the exposure politics brings because I ’ ve been visible my whole life because of my appearance I don ’ t blend and even before I got into politics I was active championing for LGBT rights and I have to say the feedback I ’ ve gotten is mostly positive ” they said In fact Tolu said some of the worst experiences they have gone through had more to do with how visible they were during the spring hunting referendum than when they talk about LGBT rights Tolu said they even had received violent threats including rape threats When handling people who may not understand or not wish to understand Tolu said that they choose which path they take depending on who they are talking to “ I expect more from politicians and the media than I do when I go do house visits I mean I myself did not start questioning norms until I came out so I understand not everyone has had that privilege of been part of a community that allows them to question those norms ” Tolu also said that there are a lot of people who do not understand the law or their own rights – so the way they handle home visits or even people within their own community is with patience “ I am privileged that I can understand the law not everyone has that ability It ’ s been five years since the gender identity law was put into place and a lot of people within the transgender community still don ’ t know their rights let alone people outside the community Still five years on we ’ re still trying to educate – the work is never-ending and it ’ s often not seen because it ’ s not flashy Instagram activism ”,"['Mosta', 'Attard', 'Pembroke']","[(2246, 2251, 'LOC'), (3630, 3636, 'LOC'),

was escorted into the Gozo law courts on Friday with heightened security at the Citadella the parking area below the bastions had been shut off from public access and at least six police officers stood guard near the entrance of the historic fort The apprehension was understandable He emerged two hours later to a baying crowd of some 20 Qala residents hurling insults at him for having so easily allowed the company Carravan to take control of a foundation with disputed claims to vast amounts of land Scicluna was testifying as a witness in a court case instituted by lawyer Patrick Valentino the representative of Carravan Ltd to challenge the property titles held by Qala residents on land now claimed to belong to a 17th century foundation that long time ago arbitrarily swept up swathes of lands in Qala and Nadur In a tense two-hour sitting Scicluna seemed convinced that although the Maltese archdiocese had once challenged the pretension of the late Richard Stagno Navarra in 1992 to be made ‘ rector ’ of the so-called Abbazia di Sant Antonio delli Navarra a foundation created by the noblewoman Cosmana Navarra after the cleric entrusted with the foundation died – his own decision in 2017 to resolve a 30-year legal battle by accepting Valentino as rector had been correct “ When I saw that so many cases had come and gone over three decades with so many people having passed away in the process I didn ’ t think of it as a ‘ short-cut ’ – one just realises that the alternative to a resolution would be the unnecessary delay of court cases Such an agreement may be viewed as a short-cut but it was a way of resolving a protracted tussle ” READ ALSO Gozo State delisted Abbazia property on Church ’ s request ‘ no questions asked But this decision appointing Carravan ’ s man Patrick Valentino as rector of the Abbazia has opened a deluge of cases Carravan – whose owners are retired magistrate Dennis Montebello and former Gozo Curia lawyer Carmel Galea as well as the Stagno Navarra heirs – are challenging title registrations on the land they claim is theirs Dozens of families face eviction or must relinquish their titles of ownership to pay higher market rates to Carravan In the meantime Carravan is also transferring properties held by the Abbazia to companies that develop the land Yet Scicluna claims he was not aware that this had been the intention of Carravan when they agreed to pay the sum of €200000 a capital sum for the Church to invest to use the interest to serve the pious obligations laid down in the Abbazia deed by Cosmana Navarra But a precedent already existed In 1992 after the death of Abbazia rector Fr Saverin Bianco Richard Stagno Navarra obtained a controversial decree from Magistrate Carol Peralta all in the space of 24 hours – without the Church being notified – to be made the Abbazia ’ s rector Stagno Navarra used that decree to transfer the lands to Carravan The Church protested and filed a case challenging the decision in 1992 which was finally resolved in 2013 in their favour Joint Office delisting So why did Scicluna accept the 2017 resolution to give control of the Abbazia to Carravan again The Archbishop claims a 2010 court case decided by Judge Gino Camilleri had decreed that the Abbazia was not “ ecclesiastical ” but “ lay ” It had been founded by Navarra for her heirs not for the Church he said and that the Church had held control only because no direct descendant was able to take control of the foundation so the Abbazia would have to be managed by a cleric Since it was “ lay ” the property held by the Abbazia could not even be transferred by the Church to the Joint Office the government office that manages church-owned property transferred to the State since 1987 “ In 2013 the Joint Office accepted the deletion of the property from Annex 8 ” Scicluna told the Court But even this is a matter of extensive debate The director of the Joint Office Duncan Mifsud testified in the same case saying that his office deregistered the Abbazia from Annex 8 based on declarations submitted by the ecclesiastical authorities “ Every single entry in Annex 8 is examined by the Joint Office to see which title the Church has or does not Some of them have been deleted or corrected or others that were not included back in the day ” So it was the Church that asked for the deletion of the Abbazia by presenting its request to the Joint Office control committee which includes two government representatives and two Church and Holy See representatives But Mifsud also confirmed that no cross-checks take place on such requests “ We rest on their the Church ’ s word that ’ s what the Concordat says ” Are Stagno Navarras rightful heirs Apart from appointing Carravan ’ s man Valentino as Abbazia rector Scicluna also ceded his right to approve the transfers of land under temporary emphyteusis – an observation which led to a 10-minute hiatus in court as Valentino objected to the questioning But the presiding magistrate insisted the question would be allowed “ I did not want to have to be involved in the decisions concerning the transfer of the foundation ’ s property or have anything to do with contracts and transfers ” Scicluna said But the defence led by Jean Paul Grech questioned why Scicluna had also accepted to appoint as Abbazia rector a person who was not even connected to the Cosmana Navarra lineage as required by the deed and taken money from Montebello and Galea – unconnected to the Navarra lineage both contributed to the €200000 capital payment to the Church in 2017 apart from the Stagno Navarras “ What was important then was that the foundation and its known associates were paying maybe some parties did not have enough liquidity ” The big question was about the lack of verification carried out by the Archdiocese as to whether the Stagno Navarras are truly the descendants of the Cosmana Navarra lineage No independent verification of the family tree presented by Richard Stagno Navarra back in 1992 has ever been carried out but the document itself was never attacked in any of the dozen court cases that have characterised the court saga MaltaToday understands that the direct line which Cosmana Navarra indicated would inherit the Abbazia ’ s control died out early on Richard Stagno Navarra ’ s claim to be the rightful heir was accepted only insofar that he actively demanded his recognition as Abbazia rector since 1992 together with Montebello and Galea as his backers “ I rested on the 1992 decision by the late Archbishop Giuseppe Mercieca that Stagno Navarra was only refused to be rector because he was not a cleric I made no verifications as to the claim and neither did my office do such a verification No doubts had ever been presented on this claim ” Scicluna told the court admitting he did not know who had drawn up the family tree presented by Stagno Navarra in court “ It ’ s something that would have to be verified ” But the Archbishop felt that since Carravan and the Stagno Navarras had guaranteed the legitimacy of their claim he could see no problem with their demands Indeed it was on the point of the heirs ’ legitimacy that the defence asked the Court to consider its request to challenge Valentino ’ s and Carravan ’ s juridical interest in the case given that there was no guarantee that they are legitimate claimants to the Cosmana Navarra lineage and therefore as rightful claimants to the control of the Abbazia The Court refused the request saying the nature of the court case was not the Stagno Navarras ’ legitimacy to the Abbazia and that such a challenge would have to be made in a separate court case READ ALSO Gozo land grab Church took €200000 ‘

from a friendly attitude to hostility In multiple cases where the pharmacy did not sell the morning-after pill they willingly recommended other places close by to aid the caller In one case a pharmacist warned that while the pharmacy does in fact sell the morning-after pill and they themselves would sell it the next person on shift would not In another case the person who answered the phone was hostile to the caller and hung up after replying with a hostile ‘ no ’ without even letting the caller say ‘ thank you ’ Once again just like last year there was a wide range of protocols with some pharmacies requiring ID checks forms to sign and informing the caller they would have to answer a list of questions while others said nothing was required Another pharmacy told the caller that while the morning-after pill was sold over the counter it was still best to get clearance from a doctor before taking the pill Unprecedently one pharmacy even said that if the caller ’ s partner came with the ID of the person who was to take the morning-after pill that was enough This is not a standard protocol in Malta however in countries like the UK the law allows partners to pick up emergency contraception to save the person from further anxiety ‘ Identification is not necessary ’ – Doctors for Choice Speaking to MaltaToday Dr Isabel Stabile a member of Doctors for Choice said that the NGO feels adamant that identification does not need to be asked for Stabile said any questions put to the client by the pharmacist should be strictly medical such as whether the person is on the contraception pill whether they have any allergies or medical conditions such as liver disease which could cause an adverse reaction Stabile said it was important for people to know what the morning-after pill can and can not do “ It must be taken within 120 hours for one particular brand of unprotected sex it only protects the person once after which a condom should be used until the next period occurs It doesn ’ t protect against sexually transmitted diseases and if pain persists the person should seek medical attention because they could be dealing with an ectopic pregnancy ” Stabile said the NGO felt strongly that the morning-after pill should be available over the counter to those aged 16 to 18 “ The age of consent is 16 at 16 you can vote why can you not buy the morning-after pill ” “ Working in the field I know that the most common age of first intercourse is 16 – so it is madness in a country where abortion is banned not to allow 16-18-year-olds to purchase the morning-after pill over the counter ” she said ‘ Many women don ’ t know how to calculate when ovulation occurs ’ During this exercise the caller came across a pharmacist who told them that if they were far away from ovulation there was no need for the morning-after pill to be taken Stabile said the problem with giving out such advice is that many women in Malta do not know how to calculate when their ovulation occurs “ Many women in Malta still don ’ t understand their own bodies Also remember a lot of the time it ’ s hard to tell exactly when a women ’ s next period will occur You can only be sure you will not get pregnant in the first three days of your period We recommend that to be sure women take the morning-after pill ” Stabile advised She also said the morning-after pill at Mater Dei Hospital is not still available at the hospital ’ s 24-hour pharmacy “ While we have heard that women who are admitted for rape have received the morning-after pill – remember that most women who are raped are not admitted to hospital… This means that the majority of rape victims do not have access to the morning-after pill ” ‘ Personal beliefs should not be at the expense of the client ’ On conscientious objection Stabile said she respected people ’ s right to their own personal beliefs However she maintained it should never come at the expense of the client All pharmacies on Sunday should sell the morning-after pill she said “ I think in this case the science should be followed – as a professional one should be able to put science ahead of their personal beliefs ” However Stabile said a compromise would be for the pharmacy to put up a sign saying they don ’ t sell the morning-after pill and give information on the nearest facility Stabile reiterated that the morning-after pill was not abortive It is not effective once fertilization has taken place since there is not enough time for it to prevent implantation Do you want more information about the morning-after pills Are you having difficulty buying the morning-after pill in Malta Reach out to the Family Planning Advisory Service FPAS at httpswwwfpasmtmorning-after-pills or 2778003720341686 for assistance,"['Qormi', 'Marsa', 'Sliema', 'Lija', 'Attard', 'Balzan']","[(72, 77, 'LOC'), (408, 413, 'LOC'), (1963, 1969, 'LOC'), (1977, 1981, 'LOC'), (1982, 1988, 'LOC'), (1993, 1999, 'LOC')]"

Melvin Theuma ‘lies’,24/10/2021 10:55,The lawyers of Tumas magnate Yorgen Fenech are requesting that the police investigate the testimony Melvin Theuma has given in court against the man accused of masterminding the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia Fenech ’ s lawyers say Theuma the middleman in the assassination has lied about the role of Joseph Muscat ’ s former right-hand man Keith Schembri in the murder “ Theuma has given false testimony by repeatedly confirming untruths everything he has declared about Yorgen Fenech of his involvement in the Caruana Galizia homicide is a lie from beginning to end ” the lawyers said Lawyers Gianluca Caruana Curran and Charles Mercieca filed a criminal complaint in which they accused Theuma of committing perjury in court with testimony that is contradicted by the secret recordings of him in conversation with Johann Cremona a business associate of Yorgen Fenech Theuma was granted a presidential pardon in November 2019 in return for his testimony against Fenech and the men he enrolled to carry out the murder of the journalist According to the lawyers Theuma repeatedly mentioned Keith Schembri in a conversation with Cremona which he recorded on his mobile phone but then denied Schembri ’ s involvement in the assassination in court Yet in court Theuma denied the involvement of businessman Schembri in the commissioning of Caruana Galizia ’ s murder who revealed his secret offshore companies and the existence of 17 Black later revealed to be Yorgen Fenech ’ s secret company and conduit for millions to be paid to Schembri ’ s offshore company According to the secretly-recorded conversations reproduced in the criminal complaint Theuma is heard name-dropping Schembri “ Has Keith Schembri forgotten when he sent over Kenneth Camilleri outside my house at 8pm I ’ ll show him has Keith Schembri what he had told them They ’ ll be out on the 22nd one million to each of them with Kenneth in front of you ” The lawyers say that in other recordings Theuma is heard telling Yorgen Fenech himself that he was met by Kenneth Camilleri at Keith Schembri ’ s request and that he heard Schembri speaking on the phone In these recordings Theuma is heard saying “ They ’ re trying to trap me from all sides with their betrayal if he doesn ’ t come to speak to me face to face we ’ re going to have trouble I ’ ll go up to him stark naked I ’ ll tell Keith ‘ come here you hunchback ’ ‘ have you forgotten when you cried that they would be arrested before they kill her for you ’ ” Additionally the lawyers say that the recordings show both Theuma and Cremona were knowledgeable of the masterminds in the Caruana Galizia homicide the police investigations the role played by former police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar as well as of the potential pardon Theuma would receive on the Caruana Galizia homicide The lawyers quote recordings in which Cremona actively encourages Theuma to stay close to his tapes in full knowledge that he would leverage the evidence in return for a presidential pardon “ Johann Cremona and Melvin Theuma had a much deeper relationship than that he has claimed in court The same can be said of Theuma and Edwin Brincat Both men passed on confidential information to Theuma ” the lawyers said in their complaint They refer to a Security Services phone interception in which Brincat ‘ il-Ġojja ’ a long-time confidant of Theuma is heard coaching Theuma into name-dropping Yorgen Fenech in his secret recordings and other phone conversations with Cremona where former police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar is mentioned “ These are only the recordings discovered by the inquiring magistrate and the defence ” Fenech ’ s lawyers said “ The plaintiff is certain that other recordings were destroyed by Theuma – in one recording Theuma is heard giving such instructions to his partner ’ s daughter Shianne Zammit – or others have not yet been revealed to the defence by the police investigators ” The lawyers say that Theuma in court had denied knowing who was financing the assassination but that the secret recordings indicate that Cremona had told him who had paid the Degiorgio brothers €350000 “ He collected €100000 Alfred and George don ’ t know them he got them from the freemasons ” Cremona is quoted as saying “ And Arthur didn ’ t even given them to Koħħu ” Theuma replies referencing the accused Vincent Muscat il-Koħħu and his former lawyer Arthur Azzopardi In another quoted phone conversation Theuma is heard saying “ Koħħu got €300000 the cash is still at Arthur Azzopardi ” The lawyers also say that Theuma is heard saying in his recordings that there are four people involved in the assassination and that he knows that former Labour minister Chris Cardona is involved in the plot but that Cardona “ knows too much on the Degiorgios for them to shop him ” “ The version of events Theuma gave under oath was stated before the revelation of the recordings with Johann Cremona which recordings Theuma believed had been deleted for good ” the lawyers said in their complaint “ So it is clear that Theuma is knowledgeable of events that he deliberately neglected to tell the Court under oath which is itself enough for him to be found guilty of perjury and false testimony ” Theuma was also said to have denied knowing which of his properties would be raided in an impending money laundering raid in 2019 that police had intended to carry out after his name had been revealed to Interpol investigators assisting in the Caruana Galizia investigation According to court testimony Theuma stated that Cremona had only once mentioned his barn remissa and that he had denied knowing which of his properties police would raid Yet in phone recordings quoted by the lawyers Cremona is heard telling Theuma “ You tell him you ’ ve been told where you ’ ll be raided at tell him Qormi Żurrieq and Wied il-Għajn are they going to involve other people in the story ” Theuma replied “ Charmaine ” referring to his partner ’ s home “ Call Kenneth Joh ” Theuma implores Cremona then says he will warn Camilleri that Theuma will tell the police everything he knows “ I ’ ll say ‘ that guy ’ s determined he will not be arrested he ’ s determined that he will spill the beans if he gets raided you can do it whenever you want ’ ” In another phone conversation quoted by the lawyers Cremona is heard assuring Theuma that he had spoken to Camilleri about the raids “ I warned them yesterday I told Kenneth to change those two places I told Kenneth one two no women get involved ” In another segment of the complaint the lawyers say they challenged Theuma in court about an alleged €30000 paid by Edwin Brincat il-Ġojja to former police chief Lawrence Cutajar Yet the quoted recordings of this conversation were not allowed to be played to the witness at the time of counter-examination According to this recorded conversation cited in the police complaint Theuma speaks of the bribe he was to pass on to Brincat to give to Cutajar as well as claiming that Cutajar himself told him that Interpol want him investigated on money laundering breaches,"['Qormi', 'Żurrieq']","[(5822, 5827, 'LOC'), (5828, 5835, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/112422/watch_government_presents_results_of_metro_feasibility_studies,[WATCH] Three-line Metro system proposed for national discussion,02/10/2021 18:08,Prime Minister Robert Abela and Transport Minister Ian Borg have presented the results of a study on the feasibility of a mass transport system in Malta In a presentation by Transport Malta chairman Joseph Bugeja the study proposes a three-line underground transport system with 25 stops It is estimated to cost around €625 billion and would be spanned over a period of 15-20 years The three lines would distributed as follows the red Nothern line connecting Naxxar with Pembroke the green Central line connecting Birkirkara with Marsa and Valletta and the blue Southern line connecting Mater Dei Hospital with the airport and Cospicua The main stations will be in Sliema Gzira Valletta Birkirkara and Cospicua The first phase of the project that would see the construction of the entire northern line that would cost around €39 billion and would take between five and eight years to be completed Joseph Bugeja announced that ARUP group was commissioned by the Government He said that the studies were initiated in 2017 in order to find the most suitable rapid mass transport system and reach the aspirations of future generations “ A number of systems were considered however the one that is most appropriate affordable and feasible was chosen ” Bugeja did acknowledge that a metro system does present various geo-physical challenges The metro line would be underground with only a small route at level ground The aim he said is also to regenerate the urban centre and improve the quality of life of the residents The eventual system if implemented would be accompanied by a reformed bus network which would interchange with the respective underground stations with smaller buses and added frequency and outreach “ The launch of the findings of this study is just the beginning of a long process not least a national discussion on what is being proposed and where we want to go in the future “ Once the network is defined and agreed upon and additional studies are completed including geo-technical studies and an evnironmental impact assessment a fully-fledged public consultation process would be carried out In the meantime additional economic and financial cost models need to evaluate the best financial model to be used to finance such a project and operate such a network in the eventuality that Government decides to continue with the proposed network ” Bugeja said William McDade from ARUP Group said that they studied various alternatives but the underground light metro was found to be the most feasible option although it does come with a higher cost and longer delivery time McDade said that although Malta has recently overhauled the road infrastructure system the capacity of the road network is not sufficient to cater for the rate of growth McDade remarked that such a project would present a challenge of disposing the excavated rock and said that a number of locations have been assessed for land reclamation Robert Abela says the Government has the credibility to see the project through Prime Minister Robert Abela said that a realist discussion should now be held after the best mass transport solution for such a small country was identified by experts “ A project like this cost billions but it is a reality that such a project would occur over four legislatures ” Abela remarked that the labour government has credibility after embarking on the largest infrastructure project in Malta ’ s history He added that land reclamation is an opportunity to turn the generated waste into an opportunity “ In the present it does not make sense for Gozo to be connected as for it to be fiscally feasible it would require 50000 more people … Through the fast ferry we have sent a strong message that Gozo should not remain at the periphery ” said Abela Ian Borg calls for a mature discussion Transport Minister Ian Borg said that after a lot of perseverance the time has come to provide the Maltese with an opportunity to discuss the matter maturely Borg sounded caution and said that this is “ a dose of reality of what it means for the country to invest in a mass transport system justifying such a large expense ” He added that a number of questions will arise on the proposal including the elevated cost and whether better or cheaper alternatives exist Long time coming The talks on a mass transport system were adopted by the PL government with former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat confirming in 2019 that a number of studies were underway Originally the proposal was mooted in the Nationalist Party electoral manifesto of 2017 which had proposed a metro system estimated at €23 billion with a first train planned within five years In 2019 Transport Malta applied to trademark the name ‘ Metro Malta ’ with the European Union Intellectual Property Office Last September during a PL rally PM Robert Abela had put forward the question of whether the country is ready for such a huge project and a shift in mentality with regards to transport Following the 2017 election victory the Labour government embarked on a €700 million infrastracture project to rebuild all national roads More details are found on the Metro website,"['Naxxar', 'Pembroke',

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/112356/three_reasons_motorsports_land_grab_is_crass_governance,Three reasons motorsport’s land grab is crass governance,30/09/2021 07:00,1 Re-zoning industrial land for other purposes may well increase pressure on ODZ land in the future There is a reason why tracts of ODZ outside development zones land are designated as brownfield industrial zones this stock is an insurance against resorting to putting industry outside the development zones in the future If a new job-creating industry comes our way the land to accommodate it must be found without resorting to taking rural land Back in 2018 the government dropped plans for industrial expansion at Wied iz-Żring in Żejtun due to justified popular opposition A year earlier it was the Labour government that approved changes to the local plan to expand the Ħal Far industrial area by 19000qm on land now identified for a motorsport development The aim was to facilitate the development of additional industrial units at Ħal Far Industrial Area and improve the environmental amenity of the area Now the government will once again have to change local plans to accommodate the racetrack As noted by Green party leader Carmel Cacopardo it simply is “ not normal for Malta Industrial Parks to release land forming part of an industrial estate for any purpose whatsoever ” Apart from these areas the proposed racetrack will also include approximately 60000sqm of ODZ land that is surrounded by industrial developments This land would come in handy if plans need to be changed further to accommodate future industrial expansion The Prime Minister argues this expansion problem can be solved by resorting to vertical industrial development but this suggestion is not even backed up by studies assessing present and future industrial needs particularly of those sectors the country is attracting All kinds of industries have different land-use needs Vertical industrial development could intensify urban sprawl and undermine the distinction between purely industrial development and office developments This is why industrial zones are still considered as “ ODZs ” and are not included in the development zone Back in 2009 a part of Ħal Far site had been identified for the development of four land-based wind turbines certainly a more environmentally beneficial impact than a racetrack These plans were never followed through The racetrack proposal just comes in the wake of other plans to change the industrial designation of areas like Burmarrad and Ta ’ Qali to accommodate office and retail developments 2 Malta is small and even industrial zones are in proximity of protected areas and residential hamlets A noisy racetrack may be more invasive to its surroundings than a factory It is true that the Ħal Far racetrack is being proposed on a site surrounded by industrial development which lacks any ecological features worthy of protection Yet the racetrack inevitably results in noise pollution and is less than 1km away from an Area of Ecological Importance and 600m from a rural residential hamlet The Environment and Resources Authority will be duty-bound to assess these impacts before pronouncing itself on this development Moreover the Planning Authority is bound to assess the wider implications on land use of sacrificing a sizeable brownfield site which may well be put to better use Once again the government gives the impression that it can dispose of its land as it pleases It is unclear whether studies on the impact on these areas have preceded the decision to allocate the land for a racetrack Instead we are assisting to another case of piecemeal and project-driven changes to the local plans instead of a holistic masterplan which prioritises future needs and long-term planning 3 Governments are not there to please every lobby group under the sun but are there to set priorities It remains a mystery why €20 million should be invested on a racetrack to accommodate one hobby amongst many others Government is reassuring us that no taxpayers ’ money will be spent on the €20 million racetrack as the money is being spent from a national development fund funded by the cash for passports scheme But irrespective of the source this is still public money which can be spent on many other priorities and worthy causes In this case the government is choosing to spend a large amount of money on one particular popular hobby at the exclusion of others and in the absence of any attempt to set an order of priorities based on environmental social and health considerations And all this on the eve of an election where government ’ s primary concern seems to be that of securing the votes of enthusiasts Moreover all sports and recreational activities are limited by land use considerations Golf courses are a no-go in Malta because of their impact on both land and water resources There are many skiing enthusiasts and mountain climbers who travel abroad to practice their sports but nobody would dream of building a mountain equipped with artificial snow to make ski enthusiasts happy And despite the contribution to physical fitness many sports disciplines suffer from chronic lack of funds In the end governments are not there to please the loudest lobby groups or even to make hobbyists happier but to prioritise and offer leadership Being able to say no is also a mark of good governance,['Żejtun'],"[(534, 540, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/111874/local_plans_how_labour_acts_like_the_pn_is_still_in_power,Local plans: How Labour acts like the PN is still in power,10/09/2021 08:14,While the 2006 local plans did contain positive aspects like the designation of a number of green enclaves in urban areas and the delineation of urban conservation areas UCAs this massive redrawing of development zones has had far-reaching consequences for Malta They included the infamous ‘ rationalisation ’ of development boundaries which increased building zones and led to an unprecedented urban sprawl which is still incomplete And they also condemned large sites like Manoel Island Ħondoq ir-Rummien the Naxxar trade fair area and Mistra ridge to mega-development projects Marsaskala bay was also earmarked for a yacht marina albeit this was conditional on feasibility and environmental studies and tied to commercial development in the ex-national pool at Żonqor 1 Local plans are already being changed The local plans approved in 2006 are not cast in stone In fact there have been a number of occasions when these have been changed through planning control PC applications to change the zoning of particular areas often to facilitate new developments For example the site presently occupied by the Centerparc shopping mall in Qormi which was designated in the local plan for warehousing was subsequently rezoned to accommodate retail development Local plans have been amended to permit five-storey high retail development in Burmarrad to remove height restrictions for factories in Mrieħel and to allow residential development on the Ħal Far barracks site Land in Żonqor was transferred for the development of a private university campus even though the ODZ outside development zone component of the project had been zoned as a national park in the local plan which means the local plan is yet to be amended before any development is carried out So nothing stops the Planning Authority from piecemeal changes to local plans In the case of Marsaskala the government or the PA can change the local plan to remove the yacht marina zoning And while government had claimed compensation claims as the reason not to change the designation of Ħondoq ir-Rummien as a yacht marina site no such claims can be made with regards to the Marsaskala marina as this will be located on public land Unfortunately while the planning control mechanism has often been used to permit new development not foreseen in local plans this mechanism has rarely been used to limit development 2 New local plans can open a can of worms New local plans could see owners of land proposing more land for development but there are ways to keep the lid on this can of worms There is a difference between piecemeal revision to the local plans and brand new local plans which cover the whole island Environmentalists are understandably wary of re-opening a can of worms which could see the planning process once again drowned by requests to maximise the financial values of individual plots and properties A similar process by the newly-elected Labour administration in 2013 simply resulted in hundreds of requests for additions to the building zones In Gozo according to information tabled in parliament almost 500 requests were made for an extension of boundaries Nationally the process attracted 4000 submissions mostly from landowners who had missed the bus in 2006 and were keen on taking a ride on Labour ’ s new bus The demands were so blatant that even a pro-development Labour administration had cold feet especially following the resurgence of the environmental movement after the Żonqor protests of 2016 and subsequent campaigns spearheaded by Moviment Graffitti Moreover citizens many of whom are property owners in their own right can be torn between their desire to limit development to improve their quality of life and pecuniary interests to maximize the value of their land and property Experience shows that while residents are likely to mobilise against immediate threats to their environment they are less likely to engage themselves in technical discussions related to zoning building heights and classification of land If pecuniary benefits stemming from taller buildings or extended boundaries are not excluded before the process commences it will only be natural that the most vociferous will be those who own land which could appreciate in value thanks to changes in local plans Yet this raises the question how can we redress the environmental deficit created by the 2006 local plans and subsequent tinkering of policies which amplified the negative impact 3 Labour aggravated the environmental harm of the local plans These can be ditched even in the absence of any local plan changes Design guidelines approved in 2015 translating heights in floors to height in metres simply condemned most Maltese and Gozitan towns and villages to five-storey developments This was accompanied by changes to sanitary regulations lowering the height of each floor In short these guidelines made the redevelopment of entire blocks more lucrative than ever Other policies which contributed to the urban sprawl included new policies allowing extra heights on old people ’ s homes and hotels and a rural policy approved in 2014 that gave the PA the magic wand to turn piles of rubble into stores and villas These policies can be scrapped immediately before waiting for any change in local plans The Nationalist opposition is also bound to tell us which policies it will ditch which policies it will keep and which it will change 4 Changing SPED should precede new local plans Environment and planning minister Aaron Farrugia himself has rightly excluded a change in local plans before a review of the Strategic Plan for the Environment and Development which ranks highest in the hierarchy of planning regulations But much depends on how this is changed For example the present SPED simply states that land outside development zones must remain ‘ approximately ’ the same as today which leaves room for further tinkering on individual plots Instead the new policy could make it clear that no presently ODZ land is ever added to the development zone The SPED could further limit development by enshrining solar rights as once contemplated by Labour and by giving the PA greater flexibility in turning down developments which although within policy constitute over-development in particular areas 5 Changing local plans can be an opportunity for communities to reimagine Malta If the local plan process is limited by a new SPED overruling any extension of ODZ boundaries or any increase in building heights local communities and environmentalists will be the ones calling the shots as developers and property owners will have nothing to gain from the process over and above what they have today This will also facilitate the democratisation of a process solely aimed at making our towns and villages liveable Rather than only having six regional local plans as is the case today one could have detailed plans for each of Malta ’ s 68 localities with the new local plans delineating new open spaces and enclaves in each locality Such plans should be designed with involvement of local councils citizens assembled in physical and virtual town hall meetings and committees of village elders focus groups of randomly selected citizens locality stakeholders and NGOs Obviously the Planning Authority on an equal footing with ERA and Superintendence for Cultural Heritage should still give technical input to councils in drafting these local plans The golden rule should be that all meetings related to local plans are made public and streamed One crucial aspect of the new plans should be that of extending urban green enclaves and granting these areas the same status as ODZ The second crucial aspect is a revision of height policies in a way which respects local character and avoid the canyon effect The third crucial aspect is to extend UCAs and protect the character of traditional neighbourhoods It remains incomprehensible why areas like Fleur de Lys were not included in UCAs 6 The government should build a strong legal case for changing local plans rather than use hypothetical compensation claims based on ‘ development rights ’ as an excuse for not changing anything Where there is a will there is a way Policies which gave owners new development rights as was the case with the abusive fuel station policy approved in 2015 have already been changed in a more restrictive way And in doing so the government has faced no legal challenge whatever despite excluding all agricultural plots from such developments For the degeneration of our towns and villages is rooted in an accumulation of different policies approved in the past twenty years with the sole aim of changing goal-posts in favour of developers Unfortunately without even publishing the legal advice given to it government has claimed that any restriction of development rights enshrined in local plans would result in massive compensation claims by owners And despite its supposedly newfound green credentials the Nationalist opposition is committed not to take away any development rights enshrined in local plans ensuring that any PN victory would leave the status quo intact Still experts in European law who spoke to MaltaToday have dismissed the legal basis of ‘ development rights ’ citing a number of cases decided at European level where similar claims have already been shot down What is sure is that with regards to the environment Malta has to start with a clean slate freed from the shackles of past mistakes Ultimately the greatest obstacle to reform remains the perception that the state is in bed with developers For who would trust politicians who are in the pockets of developers with tinkering with local plans,"['Naxxar', 'Marsaskala', 'Qormi',

He was educated at Stella Maris College and St Michaels College of Education He pursued other courses at the University of Malta and Dale Field Studies Centre in Wales But the death of Guido ’ s father made him the breadwinner for his family making it impossible for him to enter university early on in his life In 2004 Lanfranco won the annual Literary Prize on Folklore awarded by the Maltese National Council of Books In a festschrift to Lanfranco the anthropologist Mark Anthony Falzon remembers his former colleague as a man of “ impish irreverent humour and… willingness to share his wide knowledge of nature and folklore ” It was evident that many in the academic field owed him a huge debt of gratitude Even the great anthropologist Desmond Morris hailed him as “ an exceptional scholar of the most fascinating group of islands of this planet ” Lanfranco inspired a generation of environmentalists thanks to his studiousness as well as with his newfound interest in the study of folklore discovering then how the islands were rapidly changing which desperately needed somebody to record what was soon to be lost The late Joe Sultana the founder of BirdLife Malta was an “ indefatigable friend ” in many ecological missions and before his death in 2020 paid tribute to his friend ’ s line drawings of birds carried out back in 1954 Sultana ’ s son Mark the CEO of BirdLife Malta said Lanfranco will be missed by many “ We thank him for all he has done for our natural heritage and for the legacy he leaves through his knowledge and the large amount of people he has inspired BirdLife Malta salutes him while sending our sincere condolences to his wife children and all his family ” Lanfranco was one of BirdLife Malta ’ s founders and its first president from 1962 to 1967 “ Guido was admired by many for his knowledge and passion for nature Those who were lucky to meet him would have experienced his unique skill of explaining many technical issues in the simplest of ways captivating his audience with immense passion ” Sultana said In 2015 Lanfranco was honoured with an honorary degree by the University of Malta In his oration on Lanfranco Dr Joseph A Borg said “ Occasionally we become acquainted with a person who has spent a lifetime working for the benefit of society The impact of such an individual on people from all walks of life is considerable including inspiring others to take up a particular interest or even more significantly a life-long profession Guido Lanfranco is an outstanding example of such an individual ” “ Old age is no winter for Guido ” Louis J Scerri wrote of the much loved Lanfranco in 2020 “ rather a bountiful autumn when he can look back at his hard work and enjoy the rich harvest he has worked for throughout his life He will take pride in the fact that not a few scholars have taken up his life ’ s work and console himself that he was able to love and cherish the islands before their depredation by the money-corsairs We on the other hand are left with the sad dregs ” His publications include Guide to the Flora of Malta 1955 1960 Maltese Mammals 1969 Field Guide to The Wild Flowers of Malta 1969 1977 Complete Guide to

on website,11/08/2021 07:46,Nicholas Grech the man believed to be responsible for the Mosta cat killings but acquitted of all charges due to insanity is challenging his seven-year detention inside the Mount Carmel mental health facility Grech now aged 44 was in 2014 sentenced to be kept at Mount Carmel Hospital for as long as is necessary after court-appointed psychiatrists had told the courts he had no criminal intent during a four-year stint of mock crucifixions of cats and dogs Grech was said to have been suffering from impaired judgement due to his mental condition and was declared insane and therefore not criminally liable for his actions He had since been held in custody at Mount Carmel Hospital without any means of communication the lawyer said “ This arrest is illegal and with or without cure Grech appears to have recovered ” his lawyer Rachel Tua said presenting documentation from medical professionals saying Grech can not be incarcerated without any prospect of being freed Tua is asking the courts to hear witnesses previously involved in Grech ’ s psychiatric assessment to determine whether there are still grounds for his continued detention Habeas corpus is a legal remedy whereby a person claiming unlawful detention or imprisonment is brought before a court to have the legality of the arrest examined Such cases are always regarded as urgent Grech an engineer from Mosta had been charged with animal cruelty violation of burial grounds trespassing on religious grounds forcing entry into the Mosta parish church and the Speranza chapel and vilifying the Catholic religion The hangings and crucifixions of dog and cat carcasses around Mosta dated back to 16 October 2011 with the last case taking place on 3 February 2014 In the last incident a dog and cat were found hung upside down at the side and on the front of the Mosta Church Grech would find dead animals to hang accused claiming that it was his way of “ passing on a message against animal cruelty ” In a website he has been running from the mental health facility he is incarcerated in Grech documented the entire saga of his psychiatric evaluations the medicines prescribed his complaints to mental health commissioners and his protestations at specialist psychiatriat Dr David Cassar ’ s evaluations of his mental condition whom he blames for his prolonged detention Grech was already committed back in 2002 on a diagnosis by David Cassar due to paranoid psychosis schizophrenia and mental alteration Grech has complained to the Commissioner for Mental Health on several occasions as well as the Ombudsman and the Chairman of Psychiatry over the side-effects he was incurring from the administration of Fluanxol In a complaint to mental health commissioner John Cachia the ombudsman requested Cassar to prescribe Grech a medicine that causes “ less side effects ” Instead Grech was administered Risperdal Consta a long-acting injection which the inmate claims causes him just as many severe side-effects “ Every time you are injected this diabolic poison you feel humiliated helpless forced by a pimp into prostitution You know another part of you of your health is lost but can do nothing other than seeing your strength go away a bit by bit ” Grech wrote in his online blog Grech complained that he suffered from difficult to sleep due to the injection and Parkinsonism in his left leg He also said medical doctors doing ward rounds made light banter of the Risperdal ’ s side-effect of impotence by jokingly suggesting the prescription of a specific medication to reverse that effect “ He is killing and disabling me slowly slowly first with the injection Fluanxol that so much makes you sick with depression that it makes you commit suicide and then with injection Risperdal which besides making you suffer from depression with it he was also making me sick with Parkinson disease amongst others and now with Olanzapine that makes you drowsy suffer from delirium and can increase your blood pressure and disabled me left me suffer from impotence amongst others with their side effects ” Grech says that in 2011 despite his past problems of psychiatric evaluation he had been leading a relatively ordinary life and that he regularly engaged in exercise as a cyclist It was during these cycling treks that he would encounter roadkill whereupon he decided to use the carcasses of animals run over by cars to make his statement “ At the end I decided that instead of leaving them stranded on the roads utilise some of them and hang them crucified in several places in my hometown Mosta In a country where the agenda of the political parties is primarily dictated from behind by contractors and speculators who finance them I opted for a method that is entirely original and at the same time harms no one but nevertheless creates a sensation ” Grech wrote “ I asked myself if a crucified animal would make them think of those forgotten chameleons frogs hedgehogs and snakes to mention a few which get killed and bulldozed from their habitats because of this greed ” Grech details in his long statement of having hanged 15 animal carcasses on 12 occasions over the period of two years six of which in broad daylight all bar one occasion on the 16th of the month “ One can say that I managed to break a record there was a Police force where those assigned to the case were truly without vision that couldn ’ t predict the obvious most obvious in fact the biggest record was made by them where despite the consistencies I used in the dates in the choice of places and always in the same town they never succeeded in catching me red-handed neither getting out of home neither walking with the cumbersome of the wooden cross with the animal carcass on it tied to my belly and neither hanging it ” Grech admits he had been careless in not deleting images of the carcasses from his laptop “ They would not have had the slightest proof to incriminate me neither the slightest finger print nor any DNA evidence and during interrogation I simply told them of a CD I had at home containing all the information and history like from where I had collected the dead animals etc to convince them even more than they were already convinced that I had killed no animals ” In August 2020 Dr David Cassar approved a restriction on Grech ’ s freedom to communicate from

is objecting to the creation of a temporary caravan site on the Coast Road next to a nature reserve under its management KSU warned that the approval of the application would aggravate an “ already serious ” situation resulting from illegally parked caravans in the area In its objection with the Planning Authority the hunting group submitted photos of filth and waste left on site by caravan owners who already use the area abusively The proposed temporary caravan site is next to a roundabout opposite the Magħtab landfill occupying a stretch of abandoned road that used to form part of the Coast Road The area is 4000sqm in size It is adjacent to land which was allocated to KSU to develop a bird observatory that will include brackish water ponds for wader species The nature reserve known as l-Għadira tas-Safra is a Natura 2000 site and KSU is currently in discussions with the Environment and Resources Authority to enlarge the footprint into the area now being proposed as a caravan site The hunting organization was planning to plant trees in the area and expressed surprise at this change In their objection KSU highlighted the fact that they have a management agreement with ERA and that trees have been planted on the site allocated to them with the help of Infrastructure Malta and ERA KSU manage the site through rodent control regular cleaning watering and enforcement of the laws governing the site At the moment there is an application by Ambjent Malta on behalf of KSU and ERA for the building of a reservoir to supply water for the natural pond for which the site is named The application foresees the development of three artificial ponds to compliment the existing natural pond building of a bird-observation post and formation of a pathway Area important for wader birds ornithologists KSU pointed out that the only limited parking for this Natura 2000 site and its surrounding areas is already taken over by illegal caravans “ This area of Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq is visited by hundreds of people including bird-watchers surfers canoers amateur fishermen beach-goers and swimmers ” the organization said They also described l-Għadira tas-Safra and il-Blata tal-Għallis which is a short distance away as “ unique areas ” which offer resting grounds for many migrating and resident birds especially ducks gulls waders and other water-dwelling birds Caravans littering area KSU warned that the application could aggravate an already “ serious situation ” created by illegal caravans in the area “ The caravans started appearing around one-and-a-half years ago but continued mushrooming Today there is no space to park not even for our site manager whose full-time job is to manage the site and report to ERA ” KSU said “ Moreover caravans are littering the site emptying their excrements over the rocky shore doing their business under the trees keeping generators 247 and vandalising the trees and signs ” the organization said It warned that any temporary or permanent caravan site “ will result in the situation getting worse if enforcement is not taken seriously and done continually ” KSU also questioned how the caravan site will be serviced noting that there is no electricity water and sewage system in the area “ When KSU made an official request to the authorities for such services the reply was that it was impossible to supply electricity to the site since the closest distribution is more than 1 km away Furthermore water and sewage systems can not be supplied either since the road would have to be dug up as far as Salina ” KSU noted Scant details KSU has also asked for more details on the project since the drawings submitted in the application hardly had any It is also asked for a clear statement on what the word temporary means and whether the permit when issued will be time-barred The Naxxar council has also objected demanding a clarification on the “ temporary ” nature of the proposed caravan site “ Does the word temporary refer to the length of time for which permission is being sought or to the fact that caravans are ‘ temporary ’ structures If the former then what is the timeframe for use of the site for the parking of caravans ” The application for the development of the caravan site was submitted by Infrastructure Malta but according to a spokesperson the road agency was simply “ assisting ” the Environment Ministry in what it described as “ minor civil works required to set up the two temporary caravan sites at Armier and Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq ” A spokesperson for the Environment Ministry had told MaltaToday that the Baħar

IIP",25/04/2021 07:00,Receipts for Pastizzi from Rabat ’ s famous Crystal Palace Bar and for a Red Bull from a nightclub in Paceville were amongst the so-called “ genuine links ” presented by IIP candidates in order to prove the ties they had developed to Malta as they sought to get their hands on a passport Applicants for the Individual Investor Programm – Malta ’ s €115 million cash-for-passports scheme for the global rich – allowed them to spend just an average of 16 days in Malta out of their supposed 12-month residency period The system was put in place by Henley Partners the IIP ’ s ‘ concessionaire ’ and the government agency Identity Malta which effectively reduced the residency process to a box-ticking and score-granting exercise documents revealed in the Passport Papers show A scoreboard was drawn up through which authorities could determine whether an applicant had established what they called “ genuine links ” to the island – with different things such as the purchase or rent of property the purchase or renting of a vehicle a donation to a local charity membership in a local club or organisation the creation of a bank account were given different point scores An applicant then had to aim to overtake a certain threshold score Henley Partners would advise their clients as to how they could reach the score especially if they have spent not nearly enough time in Malta days spent in the country granted one points as well Identity Malta however advised Henley not to simply stick to the minimum “ Please advise your clients to avoid going by the absolute bare minimum initiatives as this could give rise to difficulties if seen by the regulator ” an Identity Malta official told Henley Partners in August 2015 A month later another official advised “ to stop looking at the barest minimum ” when a Henley client representative asked for help on how many genuine links were needed to satisfy the regulator given that her client had not spent a lot of time in Malta It is perhaps this desire by Identity Malta to see comprehensive evidence of these so-called links to Malta that led to some candidates providing anything and everything in an effort to prove their ties to Malta The most common “ genuine links ” presented by applicants are without doubt flight tickets – be they airlines or by private jet – and hotel bookings Most applicants stayed in high-end hotels such as the Westin Dragonara the Intercontinental and the Excelsior – rather than in the property that they were renting on the island during their residency period The Malta Independent and MaltaToday have already exposed how many applicants would rent a lacklustre property at the barest minimum of prices in order to satisfy the residency requirement and then not spend a single day living in it A number of applicants then donated between €5000 and €10000 to different local charities – with Puttinu Cares Dar tal-Providenza and the Malta Community Chest Fund proving to be the most popular – having been recommended to clients by Henley in the first place Some also took out membership at gyms – normally the gym of the hotel that they would be staying it – while others became members of an organisation such as Marsa Sports Club or the Malta Society of Arts This is where the links start to get tenuous at best a number of clients took to scanning and sending every single receipt of their stay in Malta Amongst documents seen by this newsroom in clients ’ genuine links folders one can find receipts from restaurants or cafes from supermarkets museum tickets and receipts for taxis as well Receipts for expensive purchases were also included One applicant spent €6000 at Sterling Jewellers while another spent €4000 at the same shop Someone else spent €800 at the Loft interiors shop while another applicant spent €1761 at a restaurant in Pietà – €1550 of which was on two bottles of wine One particular applicant sent in a 37-page document of receipts for things ranging from purchases from the duty free at Rome ’ s Fiumicino airport to museum tickets to receipts for a toothpaste purchase and even a receipt for an ice-cream Another applicant arranged a host of bus tickets onto a piece of paper and scanned them to include in her pack of evidence while two more applicants included a traffic fine as evidence of their ties to the island as well one fine was for parking on a single yellow line and the other was for parking too close to a corner Cinema tickets were also included by some applicants as evidence of their links to the island One particular folder contained a receipt for a massage with extra oil as well Another applicant included two receipts for pastries and drinks from Rabat ’ s Crystal Palace Bar better known as is-Serkin while another including a receipt for a €390 can of Red Bull from the Havana nightclub in Paceville A grocery receipt – for a loaf of bread a one-litre carton of milk and two cans of baked beans – was also included in one of the folders as was a slip of paper showing a failed withdrawal from a Bank of Valletta ATM in another client folder In all of the above cases the links presented were felt to be genuine enough for Identity Malta to accept There were several more well-intentioned examples presented as links A number of applicants presented certificates of them and their children having completed English languages courses on the island while one applicant even presented an Agenda bookshop receipt for the purchase of some Maltese grammar books One applicant – Vadim Vasilyev who was CEO of French football giants AS Monaco at the time – personally visited the Dar Sagra Familja in Zabbar and donated €15000 to the home for the repair of the roof of its playroom besides also presenting some AS Monaco football kits – much to the delight of the nun who runs the house who then wrote to Vasilyev to express her thanks Likewise Vasilyev met with an amateur football team and their squad also presenting them with some AS Monaco memorabilia Another applicant sponsored the Russian translation of Trevor Zahra ’ s ‘ The Secret Life of Grandmother Genoveffa ’ which actually became the first Maltese novel translated into Russian Such exceptional examples however were few and far between With the first round of the IIP concluded the government is now planning a second round with slightly altered requirements including what they described as an added emphasis on building links between applicants and the community On his part former Identity Malta CEO and current Komunità Malta CEO Jonathan Cardona – who was Henley ’ s main contact at the regulator for IIP-related matters – said that “ physical presence in contrast with legal residence is not a precondition to acquire nationality in Malta nor in any other EU member state Komunità Malta – which has replaced Identity Malta as the agency for the IIP now simply dubbed citizenship by investment – on their part said that the genuine links scoring system was a management tool created by them and Henley “ to ensure common standard practices in a fair and consistent way ” In a reply sent to a raft of questions from the collaboration Henley said they are “ fully aware of the potential inherent risks in handling client applications for residence and citizenship and have invested significant time and capital in recent years to create a governance structure that is committed to the highest of standards with due diligence at its heart ” “ However ultimately it is the responsibility of the countries involved to investigate and vet applicants ” they said Reporting by Nicole Meilak from MaltaToday Albert Galea from the Malta Independent This is a joint investigation by The Malta Independent MaltaToday and

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/108710/analysis_dingli_impasse_why_new_roads_should_always_require_permits,[ANALYSIS] Dingli impasse: why new roads should always require permits,01/04/2021 10:14,Infrastructure Malta did not require a permit to carry out roadworks in the vicinity of the scheduled Santa Duminka medieval chapel which passed right through 300-year old carob trees This is because a legal notice dating back to 2008 exempts state bodies from seeking permits for the development of schemed roads or rather lines drawn on maps in this case dating back to 1965 which were carried over in the local plan published in 2006 But while in some cases these works do follow the lines set out in plans as in a similar case in Żabbar in the Dingli case the map drawn on the local plan did not cross over the development zone boundary It was only later in the absence of any public consultation that the Planning Authority gave its “ interpretation ” by coming up with a new alignment protruding into the ODZ outside development zone boundary to ensure an 8-metre width for the new road which is the minimum width required by law This suggests that as proposed in the local plan the new road was not even feasible And this may well be the reason why plans remained on paper and were never implemented By redrawing the lines again the PA was duly obliged to re-consult the public – but it did not In this case the PA simply implemented what had been already decided by Infrastructure Malta But even if one were to give the PA allowance in deviating from its own local plans for practical considerations the invocation of a legal notice which exempts schemed roads from the planning process raises a number of questions When old line drawings prevail One consideration to be made is that many schemed roads were simply carried over in the local plans from plans dating back to the 1960s at a time when environmental awareness was at its infancy and when no public consultation took place Moreover these schemed roads were a minor detail included in bulky local plans dealing with a vast variety of issues which were approved after one single round of public consultation The office of the Ombudsman had found this process defective Therefore does it make sense to commence works on roads whose inclusion in local plan was more or less a formality The reality is that residents are now waking up to unannounced roadworks only to be told to “ shut up ” because the lines had already been drawn before they had reached adulthood and in some cases even before they were born An experienced planner involved in the local plan process had this to say when asked on the legality of the road works in Dingli “ If it is a schemed road then the laying out of a road is permitted development but this is subject to various provisos such as that the schemed extent of the road is not exceeded ” But as for the spirit of planning “ if there were people with a shred of decency they would subject the development to an application process given that it is undisturbed land and still in use for agriculture… There are various issues involved and those issues can only be assessed and decided upon through a proper application process ” One law for the Gods Common citizens in Malta still have to go through the formalities of the planning process for works carried out in their own home Yet large-scale projects protruding into the ODZ are being exempted from such requirements These requirements include the fixing of signs announcing the proposed works the publication of plans showing the full extent of works the request of comments from environmental and heritage authorities and public consultation In contrast IM commenced the works before even concluding the expropriation of private land in the area and without even publishing a plan showing the full extent of road works The setting of a medieval chapel According to a planning circular issued last year if a development is proposed in the vicinity of a scheduled building like the Santa Duminka chapel the developer will even have to submit photomontages and other studies to assess the impact on the setting of the monument But no such requirements are needed for roadworks next to the medieval chapel in Dingli In this case the chapel was only scheduled in October 2020 following the first protests by Moviment Graffitti – eight full years after the request for scheduling was made by the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage Moreover the scheduling failed to identify a buffer zone around the chapel and to protect the trees which form part of the setting of the monument And since no planning application was submitted the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage never had a chance to express its views on the proposed roadworks ERA becoming Ian Borg ’ s lapdog In the case of the scheme road buildling the only permit required was a nature permit for the uprooting of centenarian trees duly issued by the Environment and Resources Authority But here one has to take note of the testimony given in an appeals case presented by Moviment Graffitti by Alfred Baldacchino a former assistant director of ERA ’ s precursor the Environment Directorate in the Planning Authority an expert who distinguished himself as an outspoken critic of former planning Minister George Pullicino “ If ERA was worth its mettle and could understand the ecological economic social aesthetically and hydrological value of these carob trees it has endorsed for destruction it would have immediately issued a Tree Protection Order and possibly declared a Tree Protection Area where they grow Instead it issued a permit for their destruction ” Baldachino said For the law perfectly entitles ERA to protect ‘ trees or woodland communities of scientific ecological aesthetic historical cultural arboricultural silvicultural agricultural educational or landscape interest ’ by issuing a tree protection order This raises the question on why ERA simply rubber-stamped IM ’ s plans instead of using its powers to protect trees which apart from their scientific value undeniably have a historical and landscape interest in view of their location next to a medieval chapel And this raises another important question Is the balance of forces now skewed in favour of infrastructural works One may well suspect this was all part of the plan when Ian Borg was appointed by Joseph Muscat as his all-powerful planning and infrastructure minister It was no surprise when roadworks in San Gwann were commenced in the absence of any planning permit immediately after his appointment Many hoped the situation would have improved after Aaron Farrugia ’ s appointment as Planning and Environment Minister But judging from ERA ’ s complicity in the uprooting of trees in Dingli it seems this ministry is still subjugated to the Infrastructure Ministry and is unable or unwilling to take steps to rein in the road building frenzy Back to the future It would be a mistake to ignore how much Malta has changed since 2008 when the legal notice exempting road projects by state bodies from seeking planning permits was introduced Not only have people become more aware of the importance of the environment in their life but they are also more vigilant Talking to residents in the close-knit Dingli village is instructive too many of them are convinced that the roadworks serve one purpose – that of opening up the area for more building development That said one has to recognise that infrastructural works are crucial in improving connectivity in the island and that most decisions in this sector are bound to be a double-edged sword sometimes improving residents ’ quality of life in one area at the cost of the environment in another So neither should one assume that any road planned by IM is wrong It is the procedure for approval which needs changing from a top-down imposition to a meaningful consultation moderated by urban planners and not by road builders One possible solution would be a public consultation exercise in each locality where all pending schemed roadworks are reappraised based on modern realities and the input of environmental and heritage authorities All residents living beside these roads should be invited to town hall meetings where the authorities listen to their concerns In the absence of this the risk is that a rogue Infrastructure Malta will keep using the tools it inherited from a past Nationalist administration to ride roughshod over local communities And

07:45,Malta remains the site of a contested battle for some €90 million held at the Bank of Valletta in the name of Muatassim Gaddafi son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi ’ s sons which were managed by the Maltese accountant Joe Sammut a former Labour Party treasurer After a year of inactivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic Gaddafi family lawyer Charilaos Oikonomopoulos once again pleaded in testimony before the Maltese court that money held in Malta in Gaddafi ’ s name did not belong to the Libyan state The case concerns a claim by the Libyan Attorney General seeking the release of millions in cash held at BOV Oikonomopoulos told the court he wants to present witnesses who were close friends of the late Muatassim to attest as to the origin of his millions “ In all discussions I had not one single member of the family not one single friend of Muatassim was under the perception let along the knowledge that the funds in Capital Resources Ltd were providence They all confirmed that this money was made by a gentleman whose name was not Oikonomopoulos but Gaddafi while not in his father ’ s favours while not in the government of the state of Libya for internal family reasons apparently ” the Cypriot lawyer told the court “ He was allowed to travel worldwide and pick up the phone and speak with Presidents Prime Ministers of different countries arrange for provisions of different goods and services and hence get commissions which were put in Mezen International and then transferred to Capital Resources being a transparent company with a director and beneficial owner being Muatassim Gaddafi himself ” Oikonomopoulos is assisted by lawyer Louis Cassar Pullicino Lawyer Simon Micallef Stafrace was nominated by the courts to act as deputy curator on behalf of the unknown heirs of Mutassin Ghaddafi Oikonomopoulos is tasked by Gaddafi ’ s widow Safia Ferkash to prevent the Libyan state from obtaining the release of the funds held by a Maltese company called Capital Resources and Mezen International The Libyan AG ’ s lawyer in Malta is Shaheryar Ghaznavi In court Oikonomopoulos also presented a Dutch court document officialising the wedding of Muatassim Gaddafi to Dutch glamour model Lisa van Goinga who bore Gaddafi a son and heir on 4 February 2012 just months after Mutassim ’ s death at the hands of Libyan government rebels “ In conjunction with Sharia law… the only heirs of the late Muatassim Gaddafi are his mother Safia Ferkash by one-sixth of his estate his widow and his child… his son by the remainder ” Oikonomopoulos said claiming Gaddafi ’ s widow wanted to relinquish her share in favour of her grandchild Oikonomopoulos complained that most Gaddafi family members remain unable to travel due to an international ban and asset freeze He also said three witnesses he wanted to testify were unable to travel one of them was Mohammed Shibani who is facing a criminal case in Tunisia and has had his passport rescinded Naser Enhamed Mohammed Alkadasie a cousin of Muatassim Gaddafi who lives in Egypt and a Libyan refugee Nabil Saleh who lives in France who so far has been unable to procure a COVID test to be able to be cleared for travel to Malta Muatassim Gaddafi died at the Battle of Sirte after being captured by anti-Gaddafi forces on 20 October 2011 He was later executed along with his father He was 36 Gaddafi ’ s representative Saleh Drah was introduced to Bank of Valletta by Joe Sammut for a meeting with then CEO Charles Borg According to bank witnesses due diligence on the company Capital Resources was based on the bank ’ s prior knowledge of Gaddafi ’ s activity from another company account he held at the bank A United Nations panel of experts in Libya has been analysing the bank accounts of Capital Resources and Mezen International Capital Resources had at least €55 million transferred to it from Mezen But the main source of funding for Mezen was a third company Moncada

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/107849/inside_the_pns_30year_plan_for_electricity_generation,Inside the PN’s 30-year plan for electricity generation,22/02/2021 09:43,Malta will require a second interconnector within the next five to 10 years as the shift to electric cars will increase electricity demand Ryan Callus says The construction of a second electricity cable to connect Malta to the European grid forms part of the Nationalist Party ’ s energy plan unveiled last week The project will be the first major undertaking if the PN is elected to government Callus tells MaltaToday as he outlines the timelines for the proposals An engineer by profession Callus is fronting the PN ’ s energy plan that was communicated last week without much detail as to the timelines and expenses involved Among the proposals is a floating wind farm set some 20km offshore He now says that a floating wind farm could be commissioned around 2036 at the same time that the 18-year power purchase and gas-supply contract with Electrogas expires But Callus is unfazed by the criticism that the PN plan lacks costings The financial aspects of major projects like these can make or break them but he insists the PN has done its homework and will flesh out a more detailed programme in the months ahead “ This is a 30-year vision and the major generators – the interconnector and wind farm - will come on board as demand for electricity grows over the coming years especially with the drive towards greater electrification in transport and other sectors ” Callus says Bigger interconnector to south Italy The construction of a second interconnector will be the first step to start meeting this higher demand but it will have to connect to a different region in Italy he adds The existing interconnector between Malta and Sicily delivers 200MW of energy and cost €182 million when it was commissioned in 2015 It allows Malta to buy and sell electricity from and to the European grid Callus says the interconnector comes with the risk of losing all power if it is damaged or Sicily suffers an electricity outage which is why the PN is proposing a second interconnector to the south of the Italian mainland Callus does not reveal cost projections but says the longer distance will inevitably lead to a higher expense “ To make it more financially feasible we have to go for a larger cable that is capable of carrying between 350MW and 400MW to benefit from economies of scale But the additional expense to link to a different location in Italy will be justified because it will spread the risk ” he says Hydrogen at Delimara Callus insists that the gas turbines at the Delimara power stations will remain crucial for flexibility and security of supply in Malta but they will have to be converted to work on hydrogen He says Malta has to reach the target of carbon neutrality by 2050 which means electricity generation has to move away from fossil fuels Delimara hosts two power generation plants – D3 the former BWSC plant and D4 the Electrogas plant – that burn natural gas a cleaner alternative to oil but still a fossil fuel A third much older plant works on diesel and is used as a standby facility Hydrogen is a cleaner alternative to burn since its by-product is water Callus says that the development of a pan-European hydrogen pipeline network forms part of the European Commission ’ s Green Deal which is why the Delimara plants will have to be converted to work on hydrogen in 10 years ’ time “ This makes it incumbent to have a hydrogen-ready gas pipeline linking Malta to mainland Europe ” he says Malta ’ s application for EU funds to build a gas pipeline with Sicily that is also hydrogen-ready was rejected in Brussels but Callus is not convinced government was forceful enough in making its case “ It seems government had other priorities when making this application ” he says Floating wind farm far out at sea But the PN ’ s energy plan also prospects the construction of a floating wind farm situated at a distance of between 15km and 20km offshore This is radically different from a past proposal to have a fixed offshore wind farm at Sikka l-Bajda a handful of kilometres from the Mellieħa coast But floating wind turbines come at a higher cost than conventional electricity generation A 30MW floating facility off the Scottish coast commissioned in 2017 came with a price tag of €176 million A basic analysis carried out by MaltaToday shows that at this price the Scottish facility cost three times as much per MW as the Electrogas power station and LNG facility Callus acknowledges the substantial price differential but points out that the costs associated with floating wind farms are projected to drop significantly over the next decade as more European countries invest in the technology “ By 2030 in Scotland the cost of electricity produced by wind farms is expected to be just 1c higher than electricity produced by conventional means Admittedly Scotland has optimal wind conditions but research shows that the cost of electricity from fixed offshore wind farms has halved since 2010 and the same is expected to happen for floating wind farms ” Callus explains It takes an average of 10 years from planning stage to commissioning for an offshore wind farm to become operational Callus says that the PN plan envisages that process to start in five years ’ time “ We could have a floating wind farm by 2036 at the same time that the Electrogas fixed contract expires ” he says By that deadline he is convinced that floating offshore wind farms will be producing electricity at prices close to conventional systems being used today “ Wind energy is the only option that will give us the necessary boost to reach our renewable targets and decarbonise our energy generation ” Callus says READ ALSO Government says €100 million Gozo wind turbine funds within reach,['Mellieħa'],"[(4014, 4022, 'LOC')]"

Melvin Theuma,30/01/2021 13:59,Maltese police have been given information about a Dutch scam artist incarcerated in the Netherlands about services he rendered to Silvio Zammit the restaurateur implicated in the Dalligate affair In 2015 at the age of just 16 and on the run from justice in the Netherlands Julian Hofstra found himself in Malta with the cash he made on a raft of internet and affiliate marketing scams But his notoriety appears to have been known to Silvio Zammit according to information given to the police who are investigating recordings Hofstra made during his Maltese jaunt of Melvin Theuma – the middleman in the Caruana Galizia assassination whom he befriended during his extended stay at the Portomaso Hilton Bizarre According to these latest claims Hofstra met Zammit at a Maltco lotteries outlet in Sliema where the two struck up a friendship – just as Hofstra would have done with the unguarded Theuma Police were told that Zammit realised Hofstra ’ s computer skills could be useful to him specifically over a cache of email exchanges that took place between 2013 and 2015 to have their timestamps changed to 2008 or 2009 According to information known to the police the emails allegedly dealt with the John Dalli affair in which the former Nationalist minister was forced to resign as European Commissioner in October 2012 after an anti-fraud investigation found Zammit had solicited a multi-million bribe to influence anti-tobacco laws Zammit denied the allegations in a comment to MaltaToday querying why after having been charged in 2012 on the back of the OLAF investigation he would have gone through the trouble of tampering emails Zammit also said he never sent Hofstra any emails “ Hofstra worked in the vicinity of the lotto booth I managed from where he purchase lotto tickets ” The allegations prompted as expected a vehement reaction from Dalli himself who called them “ completely baseless ” “ As usual this mudslinging is timed to court decisions expected from the European Court of Justice that is to decide my appeal from the surreal sentence handed down some months ago and from the court of first instance in Belgium to decide on yhe indictment of Giovanni Kessler and Swedish Match after the Belgian Police investigated my complaint for defamation and started the judicial process against them “ This is no coincidence and point to the conspiracy of the corrupt media in Malta and former EU anti-fraud agency OLAF director Giovanni Kessler The latter has been protected by the Commission from any scrutiny of his illegal actions And even when the European General Court ruled that the immunity given to him should not have been reinstated after being lifted the Commission did not take any action after such a decision ” Theuma recordings These latest allegations are perhaps the strangest to emerge since the first reports about Hofstra 21 and his recordings of Melvin Theuma Hofstra now in a Dutch penitentiary shared recordings he made of Theuma allegedly speaks of his fear of Keith Schembri and retribution by the former chief of staff to prime minister Joseph Muscat Lawyers of Tumas magnate Yorgen Fenech the man accused of being the mastermind of the assassination travelled to Amsterdam to listen to the recordings captured by the one-time fugitive from justice a teenage scam artist who spent a few years in Malta staying at the Hilton In these recordings Theuma would have confided to Hofstra that he feared for his life namedropping Keith Schembri and his interest in the Caruana Galizia investigation Hofstra who was sentenced to 24 months in prison last October walked right into the timeline of the Caruana Galizia investigation after striking up some sort of friendship with Theuma who ran the lucrative white-taxi stand outside the Hilton Portomaso and was on speaking terms with the then-teenager Hofstra had ran away from the Netherlands to Malta in 2016 with thousands in cash he made in an affiliate-marketing scam It is believed Theuma confided in the Dutch teen – a fixture at Portomaso as he burnt through the cash he amassed from a series of internet cons – and blurted out his concerns about his fate at the hands of Keith Schembri Late last year Hofstra was found guilty by a Dutch court of having scammed unsuspecting victims by posing as a bailiff or even demanding ransoms by claiming he had kidnapped the relatives of hospital workers He had been arrested in December 2019 at the Tivoli amusement park in Copenhagen having spent the previous months moving between Malta Germany and Denmark Even when he was arrested and referred to a psychological examination by request of the public prosecutor he was said to have deceived the psychologist by fabricating a disorder in a bid to receive a lower sentence A court report seen by MaltaToday states he had been previously diagnosed with a form of autism and had already been involved in scams in his high school years,['Sliema'],"[(794, 800, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/106480/valletta_businesses_hoping_christmas_will_be_season_to_be_jolly_,Valletta businesses hoping Christmas will be ‘season to be jolly’,16/12/2020 07:33,Valletta businesses are hoping that a last-minute Christmas shopping bonanza will turn an otherwise miserable year into a somewhat more palatable one despite lower sales levels than previous years across the board The capital suffered the brunt of reduced sales brought about about by the COVID-19 pandemic and retailers there were left struggling divided as as to how go about revitalising business and attracting shoppers – few as they are – away from other shopping hot spots such as Sliema Tigné Paola and Birkirkara Abigail Mamo CEO of the Malta Chamber of SMEs told MaltaToday that as happened in previous years business in Valletta has once again started picking up at the beginning of December although not at the levels retailers had gotten used to in the past “ We consider the public holidays on the 8th and 13th December as regular milestones to determine retail sales levels in the buildup to Christmas ” she said “ And this year is no different in that we are seeing business in Valletta picking up pace although still far below previous years ’ levels ” Mamo said that Valletta had fared particularly bad in the pandemic the lockdown and other measures introduced to curb the spread of the virus As the Maltese took to online shopping Valletta businesses failed to attract sustained clientele to their brick and mortar outlets leading to many owners deciding to cut their losses and shut down But for those that survived the past months December could prove to be a turning point Mamo believes “ There has been a concerted effort by many parties to attract people back to Valletta ” she said “ And the numerous Christmas attractions announced play a huge part in moving people back to the capital ” Mamo said that despite the increase in online shopping registered this year people were still very much the personal experience of shopping and never more so in the buildup to Christimas David Xuereb president of the Chamber of Commerce echoed Mamo ’ s insight “ Valletta remains sluggish across the board when compared to other shopping destinations even though the start of the festive season did provide a much-needed impetus to the Capital ” he said He said that local retail trends had shifted in the past months as had happened abroad as a result of the spread of COVID-19 The major shift came about as Maltese consumers showed a preference for online solutions for their consumer needs This has been reflected in an increased demand for electronic goods as well as a drive towards contactless business “ With regards to traditional retail the current situation is varied Certain sectors remain struggling while others are recovering slowly although revenues of previous years remain a distant ambition ” Xuereb said Among those worst-hit is the high fashion sector with Chamber members reporting a drop of 50 in sales when compared to last year Beauty products on the other hand seem to be on demand even though not on the same levels as last year And luxury items such as watches and jewellery have also registered a positive trend For months a number of retailers had been complaining that the business community in Valletta needed to realise that doing things “ the old way ” was no longer tenable and that the mentality among many owners employees – as well as some associations – needs to change Amongst the proposals often floated but not agreed upon is to introduce late night shopping in Valletta For contrary to what happens at Malta ’ s most visited shopping centres – and across major European capitals – shops in Valletta tend to close promptly at 7pm barring some pubs and restaurants One vocal proponent of late-night shopping is Valletta ’ s mayor Alfred Zammit who has been advocating for change ever since being elected to the post a year ago “ Late night shopping would lure Maltese shoppers back to Valletta at least in the evenings after work ” he told MaltaToday “ And our other businesses including catering establishments bars and pubs would keep those shoppers in the capital for even longer ” Zammit has proposed a trial period over which Valletta outlets would open from 10am to 10pm every Friday “ I am not suggesting introducing late night shopping every day because that might not be doable straight away but I firmly believe that Maltese shoppers would choose Valletta over other shopping destinations if they were given the opportunity to shop comfortably after work ” he said Such a scheme would require the approval and backing of all business in the capital as well as the associations and organisations representing And unfortunately that tacit agreement is what ’ s currently missing “ I have spoken about this to the Chamber of SMEs but I have found little support ” Zammit said “ This coupled with the endemic short-sightedness of many businessmen means that we appear destined to remain stuck in this mess ” Zammit said that late night shopping or not Valletta still has a lot to offer “ With social distancing measures in place and everyone wearing masks Valletta is the ideal shopping destination offering retail catering and entertainment like no other spot ” he said “ Indeed Christmas would not be the same without a shopping spree in the capital ”,"['Valletta', 'Sliema', 'Paola', 'Birkirkara', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta', 'Valletta',

an unthinkable balancing act attempting to keep everyone happy by overlooking the contradictions emerging in Labour ’ s hegemonic block A rant too far Yet at that stage the damage to Labour ’ s optics was already too great for Labour not to distance itself from Cutajar For unlike less outspoken developers Anton Cutajar had broken one major rule that of externalising his threat to use his political connections to put pressure on a public official on the social media “ I am telling you right here if you keep it up I will send letters to who I need to send them and your time as commissioner will be up ” Cutajar said in a Facebook livestream Moreover his attack was targeting a public official who best incarnates the promise of 2013 a young principled dynamic woman threatened by an aggressive male zookeeper The optics were too bad for Lydia Abela the PM ’ s wife and an animal rights advocate in her own right not to reprimand Cutajar At that stage Cutajar had no choice but to remove his offensive post and partly retract expressing a willingness to work with the commissioner One may say that Cutajar himself is an easy target simply because his threat to Bezzina was too blatant to be ignored unlike more sophisticated lobbyists who get what they want without ever exposing themselves and damaging the political optics of those who favour them Yet Cutajar himself may have been led to believe that he is powerful For not only was his ‘ zoo ’ regularised in 2017 but he has now applied to sanction illegal extensions which include a sizeable dwelling with pool And even his protests on proposed regulations banning the petting of wild animals found a listening ear being mysteriously removed from a draft law issued for public consultation Yet Cutajar does not play by the rules Notice the contrast with MDA president Sandro Chetcuti whose public pronouncements on environmental protection contrast with his own lobby ’ s daily actions and demands In this sense Cutajar ’ s outbursts have an authenticity which exposes the fault lines of Labour ’ s increasingly unwieldy but still effective coalition From movement to skip One risks making too many generalisations from this bizarre tale pitting an angry male zookeeper known for his retrograde views on migration he even picketed a Black Lives Matter protest in remembrance of murder victim Lassane Cisse against a young non-partisan woman appointed by a Labour government who in many ways incarnates the spirit of a forward looking cosmopolitan and liberal country But it comes at a critical juncture where Robert Abela is keen on reinvigorating the ‘ coalition ’ after it was dealt a devastating blow by last year ’ s meltdown of the Muscat administration under a dark cloud of corruption and impunity While electorally Labour has held its super-majority in the polls its moral authority has been undermined in a way which may make it easier for a renewed Nationalist party to rebrand itself under a new leader who seems keen on modernising his party In a sign of the danger posed by outbursts like those of Cutajar Bernard Grech himself has shown tact by immediately expressing solidarity with Bezzina aided by Cutajar ’ s own tribalist pigeon-holing of the animal rights commissioner the independent media and animal rights activists with the “ anti-Labour crowd ” whom he regularly accuses of lashing out against him because of his “ political DNA ” Abela has so far sent mixed messages keeping the populist right-wing on board by pushing the “ full up ” narrative on migration but showing greater disposition to redress the environmental deficit and take small but significant steps at removing impunity for the protagonists of Panamagate Yet Labour has its dissonant discordant voices ranging from Schembri loyalists to xenophobes who distort its media optics Whether Abela can resurrect his movement ’ s ‘ inclusivity ’ dream ticket from 2013 remains to be seen The risk is that without clear ideological boundaries demarcating it from the loony right which has its own roots inside Labour Abela ’ s party may end up being seen as a skip instead of a movement with a vision of a modern dynamic nation,['Pembroke'],"[(2829, 2837, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/106129/eight_things_the_reshuffle_says_about_abelas_frame_of_mind,Eight things the reshuffle says about Abela’s frame of mind,27/11/2020 09:57,With the exception of COVID-19 casualty Silvio Parnis Robert Abela did not want to dump anyone As widely expected Abela ditched Silvio Parnis as junior minister for the elderly whose reaction to a spike in COVID-19s death was a wrapped roly-poly gift telling the elderly to “ have courage ” While Abela played musical chairs by shifting a number of responsibilities and creating completely new ministries he retained everyone else in his original Cabinet in a decision probably motivated by resentment at constituency level which could rebound on Labour ’ s electoral numbers This suggests that Abela intends to go to the next election with this Cabinet in place Yet the dismissal of Parnis a district heavyweight and veteran in his own right still sends a strong message that gross incompetence will not be tolerated Buying the peace of the rest of the Cabinet comes at a price an absurdly large Cabinet and too few backbenchers to hold government into account Justyne Caruana ’ s reinstatement and the retention of Edward Zammit Lewis and Rosianne Cutajar suggests Abela has lowered the ethical bar he applied so mercilessly when Caruana was removed in January Just days after his appointment as PM and still on his political honeymoon a time when he was keen on distancing himself from the impunity characterising the Muscat administration Abela was quick to dismiss Justyne Caruana from Gozo Minister – not because of any fault of her own – over her husband ’ s formerly a high ranking police officer involved in the Caruana Galizia murder probe close relationship to Yorgen Fenech Caruana ’ s reinstatement which could also reflect a change in her personal situation indicates that Abela is now more flexible in the application of his ethical yardstick The retention of Edward Zammit Lewis and Rosianne Cutajar in their respective justice and equality portfolios despite having allegedly retained personal relations with Yorgen Fenech after it emerged that the Tumas magnate was also the owner of 17 Black is hard to interpret because the WhatsApp chats spurring these rumours have not been made public yet This may be an indication that Abela has been satisfied by the explanation given to him by the two MPs and has concluded that the cost of removing them would be greater than that of retaining them It is unclear whether Abela has pre-empted problems by demanding full disclosure from those involved or whether he is still waiting for the shit to hit the fan Their retention has surely strengthened the case for the reinstatement of Justyne Cutajar considering that the latter was not even personally connected to Yorgen Fenech when she was removed The downside for Abela whose credibility has been greatly enhanced by raising the ethical bar principally by kicking Konrad Mizzi out of the parliamentary group is that his latest decisions may be perceived as a backtracking from his stricter approach Yet it is also possible that such an approach was not sustainable in the long run in a political landscape where even the Opposition ’ s chief inquisitor Jason Azzopardi has been rebuked by his own party for taking a gift from Tumas Group albeit one occurring before the 17 Black revelations Gozo remains electorally strategic three Gozitan MPs are now ministers Gozo is Malta ’ s only toss-up district With the latest polls showing the PN led by Bernard Grech making notable gains Abela may have been keener on reinstating Caruana who commands strong constituency support in Gozo Neither can Abela afford to lose support in Gozo with its district rivalries and the resentment of MPs like Caruana She now joins Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri who is also responsible for hunting and Agriculture Minister Anton Refalo in the strongest ever Gozitan contingent in a Maltese government Caruana ’ s conciliatory temperament is also suited for her new role as education minister a portfolio which gives her visibility exposure and plenty of deliverables It remains to be seen whether she also has the depth to address structural inequalities in a system which has traditionally reinforced class divisions Robert Abela still has a pool of talent which allowed him to shift responsibilities Abela is reaping the fruits of the generational renewal on Labour ’ s benches during the past decade finding plenty of space to manoeuvre in shifting responsibilities in his Cabinet While the government is showing the first signs of fatigue made more visible by the failure of some ministers to rise up to the COVID-19 challenge Abela is trying to nip problems in the bud by shifting responsibilities and giving embattled ministers a second chance to prove themselves in greener pastures Strong social aspect Disability and the elderly have their own ministries along with social housing Following the appointment of Roderick Galdes as housing minister in January Abela has now elevated inclusion and disability included in Julia Farrugia ’ s quality of life portfolio and the elderly now the main focus of Michael Farrugia ’ s ministry to ministerial status This is a strong indication that Abela is giving more importance to the social sector than Muscat Yet Abela missed a golden opportunity to elevate equality to a separate ministry thus enhancing the present ’ s government commitment on themes like the gender pay gap and its drive against discrimination in the provision of services through the proposed equality bill Aaron Farrugia ’ s environmental portfolio has been strengthened with the addition of construction Despite misgivings among the developers ’ lobby Aaron Farrugia has not only retained planning and the environment but has also taken construction regulations under his wing Over the past year Farrugia has reshuffled planning boards removing controversial figures like Elizabeth Ellul and has commenced the reform of the PA ’ s controversial rural policy Although in the absence of new local plans Farrugia is powerless to stop the onslaught of development which is still wrecking our towns and villages his appointment has tilted the balance away from the pro development bias of the Muscat administration Julia Farrugia and Owen Bonnici have been given a second chance to prove themselves in new ministries Both Farrugia-Portelli and Bonnici have been removed from high-profile and strategic ministries Tourism and Education and given responsibility over important but not easily identifiable sectors namely quality of life now in the hands of Farrugia-Portelli and the post COVID-19 strategy now in the hands of Bonnici One may easily interpret this move as a demotion in the case of Bonnici for his bungled handling of the re-opening of schools and in Farrugia ’ s case for permits for hotel parties held in July which were partly responsible for a spike in cases Bonnici has redeemed himself by the absence of any child-to-child COVID-19 transmission but delays in the transition and disagreements with teachers ’ unions had created uncertainty On her part Farrugia-Portelli ’ s linguistic slips turned into memes by merciless critics did not help in alleviating public anxieties even if she was implementing what was essentially a collective decision Being more in line with Farrugia-Portelli ’ s sensitivities and social consciousness the quality of life and inclusion portfolios could prove a rebound for the hard-working minister who will probably feel more at home addressing social issues than dealing with the fat cats in the tourism industry Bonnici ’ s post COVID-19 strategy portfolio may actually represent an even greater challenge and much depends on his ability to coordinate strategies involving different ministries The elevation of research and innovation to a separate ministry is positive but depends on how much funds are allocated in this sector Clayton Bartolo who as the government ’ s representative on the PA board had voted for the DB ’ s city centre in Pembroke will now have to prove his independence from a powerful lobby in reshaping post COVID-19 tourism at a time when sustainability and quality of life have become government buzz words Abela is banking on Miriam Dalli and Clyde Caruana giving new impetus to the government Abela ’ s cabinet has lost the gravitas of Finance Minister Edward Scicluna but may have gained the greater dynamism of Clyde Caruana an unassuming technocrat who will also be taking over employment Caruana who as the main architect of Labour ’ s employment policies opened up the labour market to foreign workers suggests that despite his ‘ full up ’ rants Abela has endorsed the economic model of his predecessor which depends on the importation of foreign workers Former Labour MEP Miriam Dalli also brings her dose of dynamism by taking over as minister for energy from Michael Farrugia along with enterprise and sustainable development It remains to be seen how Dalli ’ s sustainable development portfolio will relate to the quality of life one under Julia Farrugia It would be a great disservice if this nomenclature were simply intended to embellish ministerial nomenclature In the energy sector one of the main challenges for Dalli will be preparing for the expiry of the five-year fixed price agreement for the buying of LNG from Electrogas in 2022 Moreover increased scrutiny over Electrogas will also test the new minister ’ s good governance credentials Dalli ’ s green credentials will also be tested in her commitment for renewable energy strengthened by her European credentials in pushing for cleaner energy in transport at

homes",26/11/2020 07:37,An inheritance battle has broken out among the heirs of the aristocrat Lord Gerald Strickland one-time prime minister of Malta which includes the magnificent Villa Bologna in Attard Once the seat of the Count of Catena the 18th century country house in Attard became the property of Gerald Strickland in 1882 after a protracted litigation between the putative heirs Now the entire estate as well as over €500000 in precious furniture and works of art inside the grand home is the subject of a court battle between siblings Jasper de Trafford who lives in the house and Aloisia de Trafford When their father Gerald de Trafford died in 2015 at 85 he bequeathed unto his son Jasper the vast contents of Villa Bologna as well as the entire property today managed for wedding celebrations His daughter Aloisia was left with a handful of furniture pieces a Copley Fielding landscape and a water-colour portrait of her father The elder daughter instantly renounced the inheritance upon learning of the will and in November 2015 gave notice to her brother and the law courts that she was expecting that she inherit one-sixth of the estate as laid down at law A court now has to decide on whether Aloisia de Trafford will become part-owner not just of Villa Bologna which is managed and lived in by her brother but also to liquidate in her favour the value of the country house ’ s belongings as well as part of a loan or donation from her father to his son to acquire a Valletta home on Battery Street In an affidavit to the court Aloisia de Trafford says her father had already drawn up a will in the records of notary Paul Pullicino in which he held his estate – in equal portions – to the two siblings “ Unfortunately my brother started working on my father and insisted that he would only come to Malta if my father were to leave him his estate to my exclusion ” de Trafford claimed “ My father was already weak and vulnerable and with my mother ’ s aid and assistance he was convinced to do so My father had previously told me that he did not want to change his will ” But in 2008 at the age of 79 Gerald de Trafford changed his will and left everything to Jasper a London banker “ As soon as the will was read out I realised that I was completely done in ” Aloisia de Trafford said claiming her brother had also been given some €90000 from their father to finance the acquisition of a Valletta home which he split into three apartments for short lets to tourists “ I knew my father had sold land and as far as I know also bonds stocks and shares to finance Jasper in acquiring the property This can all be verified from my father ’ s accounts ” The siblings also disagree on the valuation of the Villa Bologna estate with Aloisia de Trafford ’ s realtor valuing the home at €23 million while Jasper de Trafford ’ s valuation from an AP architect valuing it at €54 million His sister protested that the AP valuation is a market value for how much a third party would be prepared to purchase Villa Bologna and the gardens while allowing the heir and vendor to live on the property and benefit from the weddings operations “ In other words the prospective purchaser would be buying into a property without any prospect of turning over any income ” She called the valuation ‘ ridiculous ’ The house is currently leased out for receptions and weddings while seven apartments from the estate are leased out to foreign lessees who live there apart from a shop and café and a pottery shop “ This has all rendered good income to my brother since my father ’ s death which he has only kept for himself and I see no reason why I should not receive 8 interest on my reserved portion once he has enjoyed the income from the various leases to date ” On his part Jasper de Trafford has also doubted the validity of a 30-year renewable lease his father would have given to his sister in 2013 on the garden home at Villa Bologna “ As you know I inherited Villa Bologna with no capital and considerable debt from restoration projects at the Villa Villa Bologna is also very expensive to run with ever increasing staff and restoration costs There is now also mounting interest on unpaid transfer duties and I need to be able to raise finance to settle these as soon as possible ” Jasper wrote to his sister in November 2019 In a reply from her lawyers in January 2020 Aloisia de Trafford accused her brother of refusing to recognise the garden house lease as way of procrastinating in getting a reasonable valuation of the estate “ Despite Jasper having

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/106074/one_year_on_the_domino_effect_of_fenechs_arrest,One year on: The domino effect of Fenech’s arrest,24/11/2020 06:59,If one were to turn the clock back by a year it would end up in a completely different political landscape “ This is not my last budget ” declared Joseph Muscat somewhat prematurely in October 2019 only a month before Yorgen Fenech ’ s arrest Only before he had quashed speculation on his imminent resignation after failing to secure a top EU position some months before And despite mounting evidence linking Yorgen Fenech – one of the owners of the LNG plant in Delimara to 17 Black the secret company linked to Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi – both seemed solidly entrenched in their respective positions Even the Opposition ’ s calls for their resignation as well as that of Police Commissioner Lawrence Cutajar and Attorney General Peter Grech had fallen on deaf ears as the electorate continued to reward Labour with electoral victories On the opposition benches despite being trounced by Muscat in MEP elections in June Adrian Delia had managed to weather the storm and seemed destined to continue leading his party to an electoral wipe-out in 2022 This was the political situation in the country just a month before the army intercepted Yorgen Fenech ’ s boat as he was allegedly trying to flee the island from Portomaso Trouble on the horizon Behind this semblance of normality the country was haunted by the unresolved assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia whose shrine in front of the law courts was still regularly cleared by government officials only to be re-erected by activists While three hitmen were facing charges as the material executers speculation on who had ordered the murder had been growing since 6 October when the Times had indicated a “ major businessman ” among three potential key suspects behind the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia In another ominous sign that trouble was brewing on the horizon the United States embassy issued a statement on the second anniversary of Caruana Galizia ’ s assassination offering its support to the investigations “ if requested by Maltese authorities ” And just five days before Fenech ’ s arrest the government gave in to two years of intense international pressure by the Caruana Galizia family by appointing a public inquiry led by three legal minds deemed acceptable by the family A week before Fenech ’ s arrest in a clear sign of unease Keith Schembri avoided cross-examination about the once-secret offshore company 17 Black as he dropped libel proceedings he had instituted against former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil triggering the first in a series of street protests which rocked the Muscat administration in later weeks Muscat ’ s final days Yet even during the initial days following the arrest of taxi driver Melvin Thuema who was later granted a presidential pardon Muscat seemed determined to stay on until the resolution of the case repeatedly crediting himself for having the murder resolved under his watch Yet it was Fenech ’ s proximity to close Muscat allies Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi both linked to him through 17 Black which rendered Muscat ’ s position untenable As the days rolled on the situation started slipping out of his control as protestors took to the streets And amidst rumours of an alleged plot to frame Chris Cardona with the murder it was a Cabinet revolt which ultimately pushed Muscat to resign Still – he managed to do so on his own terms securing an acclamation in his party on the eve of an election which saw continuity candidate Robert Abela win over Muscat ’ s least preferred candidate Chris Fearne How Abela raised the bar Yet upon being elected Abela immediately sent a message that it was not business as usual by firing Schembri ally Neville Gafà from the OPM and removing police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar from office On a symbolic level one of Abela ’ s first decisions was to stop the removal of flowers from the Daphne shrine in front of the law courts thus putting an end to a farce The number of casualties linked to Yorgen Fenech continued to snowball in the next months Practically all those characters which Simon Busuttil and civil society groups had asked to resign lost their posts under Abela While Abela was often overtaken by events and media reports as was the case with footage linking former police deputy chief Silvio Valletta to Yorgen Fenech and media revelations linking the Montenegro wind farm to Yorgen Fenech ’ s offshore activities Abela did not refrain from drawing political conclusions making Justyne Caruana resign over her husband ’ s actions and firing Konrad Mizzi from the PL parliamentary group even before he was even interrogated by the police In so doing Abela has not only broken with the impunity of the Muscat years but has effectively raised the bar making it clear that political responsibility must be carried even in the absence of evidence of direct criminal responsibilities By raising the bar immediately after being elected Abela may well have conditioned his own choices in a forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle that comes in the wake of speculation on WhatsApp chats linking key members and Yorgen Fenech Ironically the dismal track record of his predecessor on governance issues has provided Abela an opportunity to shine While revelations involving characters like Mizzi Schembri Valletta and Cutajar were a stark reminder of the murky state of affairs under the Muscat administration the instant resignations of those implicated and even that of a spouse who had to bear responsibility for her husband ’ s actions provided Abela an opportunity to raise the bar on ministerial ethics which had sunk so low ever since Muscat retained Mizzi as minister and Schembri as his chief of staff Surely one may argue that Abela does not deserve much credit for restoring a sense of decency in the country But by betraying the expectations of continuity Abela has managed to positively surprise critics even by simply doing what is expected of him Rather than raising expectations only to disappoint upon being elected Abela intelligently lowered expectations before being elected in a way which makes his present actions more noteworthy The risk for Abela now is that by acting decisively he may have raised the bar too high for himself to consistently apply it He has surely raised expectations of full closure on both the Caruana Galizia assassination and Panamagate which he may find hard to satisfy without fatally undermining his predecessor ’ s legacy and place in history something which may be unacceptable for Muscat loyalists That also explains why a year after the arrest of Yorgen Fenech Abela has remained hesitant on expressing a political judgement on the attempt at state capture which characterised the Muscat era Instead Abela continues to placate these elements by resorting to partisan attacks on critics thus showing no will to defuse the kind of partisanship which clouded the judgement of Labour activists and supporters who had previously absolved Schembri and Mizzi from any wrong doing No second republic on Abela ’ s horizon Abela has been lukewarm on reforming the political system While progress has been made in implementing the Venice Commission report and limiting the powers of the Prime Minister in strategic appointments he showed little enthusiasm for more substantial reforms leading to the establishment of a ‘ second republic ’ once dreamed of by his predecessor Neither has Abela shown great enthusiasm to address the structural roots of corruption through more checks and balances and stricter rules on the financing of political parties including their TV stations Abela has reiterated his opposition to the state financing of political parties and has refrained from increasing MPs ’ salaries a pre-condition for a full-time parliament Apart from a personal initiative by Environment Minister Aaron Farrugia to start logging his meetings with lobbyists a new code of ethics proposed by Standards Commissioner George Hyzler which foresees the creation of a registry for lobbyists still has to be enacted Abela has also shown little enthusiasm to break away from the pro-business mantra and the compromises he continues to make with powerful lobbies like the construction industry and the hunting community Even in tackling the COVID-19 crisis Abela was conditioned by business lobbies in giving the country a false sense of security in a rush to return the country to “ normality ” Missing links While Abela has taken decisive steps in establishing a sense of political decency and accountability for all those suspiciously linked to Yorgen Fenech and the Panama scandals the police still have to establish whether high officials in the Muscat administration have been involved in obstruction of justice in the assassination of Caruana Galizia Neither has the police thrown any light on the alleged frame-up of former minister Chris Cardona by Keith Schembri One notable missing link remains the identification and arrest of those who made the bomb which killed Daphne Caruana Galizia a trail which could throw a light on other unresolved crimes Despite the lack of progress on several frontsm the police interrogation of Joseph Muscat Konrad Mizzi Keith Schembri Brian Tonna and Karl Cini indicates that under new police commissioner Angelo Gafà the police is less conditioned by the kind of political considerations which facilitated the culture of impunity characterizing previous administrations Creating the political environment for the police to carry out its work without fear and favour may well be Robert

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/105632/kou_claim_labour_politician_linked_to_2010_hsbc_heist,[WATCH] Koħħu claim: Labour politician linked to 2010 HSBC heist,01/11/2020 07:32,Vincent Muscat ‘ il-Koħħu ’ one of three men accused of having assassinated the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has told the police he can name a Labour politician whom he believes helped plan a heist on the HSBC Malta headquarters in 2010 Muscat has however not identified the man to the police and instead shared details of the 2010 attempted heist in which he was involved At the time the Labour Party was in Opposition Yesterday this claim was given further credence by the Nationalist MP and lawyer of the Caruana Galizia family Jason Azzopardi who alleged that a Cabinet minister was implicated in a serious crime Jason Azzopardi declared on Saturday during a programme on 103FM that Prime Minister Robert Abela has been aware since March 2020 that a member of his Cabinet – “ not a lawyer ” – has been implicated in a crime by Muscat in his pleas to police for a presidential pardon in return for information on a series of crimes In the radio show 'Andrew Azzopardi on 103 ' Jason Azzopardi said “ The Prime Minister knows he has known since March that he is not the only one who has to leave that room ” Azzopardi said referring to the Cabinet “ Because the prime minister knows that Vincent Muscat in the information he gave to police this March and I ’ m not entering into any details mentioned a person who occupies a Cabinet post a minister sitting not past - let nobody think that I am referring to some past minister - and this person is not a lawyer he did not give some advice to some perpetrator “ The prime minister is acting just like the three monkeys he hears sees says nothing No wonder we say this is a country controlled by the mafia When I say that in the Cabinet there is someone who a first-class criminal has mentioned him in connection with a serious crime that happened years ago… not connected to Daphne ’ s murder but which happened before Don ’ t ask me what the crime is He is not a lawyer… I tell you that he was not simply mentioned over some drink or meal ” The claim would leave at least nine ministers in Robert Abela ’ s Cabinet open to suspicion and five who had been MPs at the time of the HSBC heist but the Office of the Prime Minister yesterday refused to issue any comment on the allegation Muscat wants the pending trial over his alleged involvement in the 2010 failed HSBC heist to be postponed until a decision is taken on his pardon ostensibly because the information he has to offer is also related to this case Azzopardi himself refused to elaborate on who the alleged Cabinet member is or what crime he is referring to But his declaration chimed in with allegations advanced in court by Muscat ’ s lawyer Marc Sant who accused lead inspector Keith Arnaud and Kurt Zahra of playing for time in the interests of “ prominent third parties ” in delaying a decision over Muscat ’ s request for a presidential pardon According to Muscat ’ s court protest filed back in September 2020 the only reason for the “ exaggerated delay ” were hidden interests to protect “ prominent individuals ” yet to be mentioned in connection with Caruana Galizia ’ s murder Muscat held five sessions with the police between January and February 2020 detailing his knowledge of various crimes predating the Caruana Galizia assassination Muscat now wants the entire cabinet from 2017 to date including former prime minister Joseph Muscat and former chief of staff Keith Schembri to testify about his presidential pardon request Muscat says it was him who pointed the finger at middleman Melvin Theuma back in April 2018 leading police to the middleman in the Caruana Galizia assassination Muscat filed another formal request for a pardon when Theuma and alleged mastermind Yorgen Fenech were arrested by the police in connecti­on with the murder in November 2019 Marc Sant told MaltaToday earlier this week that Prime Minister Robert Abela should consider recusing himself on any Cabinet discussion dealing with a pardon for Muscat given that he previously represented the Agius brothers – mentioned in open court by Melvin Theuma as the suppliers of the bomb that killed Caruana Galizia – on financial disputes “ I hope he is aware that his is not the only conflict of interest among the current Cabinet members ” Sant said referring to his client ’ s case dealing with his request for a pardon “ In our judicial acts we did not mention prominent persons including some involved in politics capriciously ” Sant said refusing to delve any further into his client ’ s suggestions A joint investigation by MaltaToday and The Times showed the Agius brothers who police believe are at the head of an organised crime group are part of the conspiracy that supplied the bomb used to assassinate Caruana Galizia in 2017 Muscat ’ s former defence lawyer Arthur Azzopardi had told the Caruana Galizia public inquiry in 2020 that his client ’ s information had been dismissed as hearsay evidence But Azzopardi who has represented Robert Agius in fending off drug trafficking charges dropped his brief for Muscat in November 2019 MaltaToday later established that Keith Arnaud was then given the impression by Azzopardi that Muscat would recant on his claim that Melvin Theuma was the middleman in the assassination recordings between Theuma and an associate also confirm they had inside information that Muscat would be made to recant although this never happened HSBC heist The HSBC heist in Qormi had targeted the bank ’ s underground vaults The robbers included Vince Muscat and Fabio Psaila A police witness former constable Mario Portelli would later allege that the lawyer and sacked police inspector David Gatt had masterminded the heist The case was never proven in court and Gatt was acquitted At the time he shared his legal office with former Labour minister Chris Cardona Some 65 shots were fire at police who turned up on site and foiled the daring robbery which had taken full advantage of the general absence of police on duty due to the State visit of the Italian President and an Isle of MTV event A number of HSBC bank employees were interrogated by the police at the time suggesting that the police believe that insider information must have been provided to the robbers to enter the first security doors inside the building that led to the vaults An SAG police officer on duty inside the building was held hostage for some time

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/105280/voters_in_south_sound_warning_for_labour,Voters in south sound warning for Labour,15/10/2020 13:06,Robert Abela may have a growing problem on his hands as support for the Labour Party in its traditional southern strongholds has been waning since June And the problem appears to be more acute in the Southern Harbour area which includes the Cottonera Żabbar Fgura Paola Valletta and Marsa This region roughly comprises the 2nd electoral district the 4th and part of the 1st In the last general election the PL carried all three districts with comfortable margins polling 572 in the 1st 712 in the 2nd and 677 in the 4th A look at the numbers derived from the MaltaToday surveys shows that in June the PL polled 661 in the Southern Harbour region declining to 619 in July The decline continued in September when the party polled 508 In the last survey published on Sunday the PL ’ s support dipped below the absolute majority to reach 445 The South-Eastern region tells a similar story This region which includes the localities of Marsaskala Żejtun Marsaxlokk Birżebbuġa and the airport villages roughly coincides with the 3rd electoral district and the 5th These districts are also PL strongholds In the last general election the party received the support of 699 of the electorate in the 3rd District and 657 in the 5th The PL ’ s decline in the South-Eastern region started after July Whereas the PL scored 611 in the July MaltaToday survey this dropped to 504 by October Of significance is the fact the party ’ s decline in both regions was also reflected in a decline in the Prime Minister ’ s trust rating In June Abela ’ s trust rating in the Southern Harbour ran at 754 dropping to 527 by October In the South-East Abela ’ s trust rating went from 758 in July to 531 in October The last survey pit Abela against newly-elected Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech for the first time While the surveys show that the PL continues to enjoy strong overall support the downward trend in its traditional constituencies has caused ripples inside the party Functionaries at a district level who spoke to MaltaToday on condition of anonymity have pointed towards a number of issues effecting voters in these regions including rising unemployment and housing problems “ The going has not been easy for many and there are more people out of work as a result of the pandemic There is also a growing problem of housing which has not been helped by government ’ s inability to deliver a single social accommodation unit since being elected in 2013 ” a Labour veteran said Another pointed out that Labour voters in the districts were feeling let down by their own government “ People feel side-lined and there is a growing feeling that ministers are becoming unreachable ” he said Another issue of concern in the two regions is immigration especially in localities that house large immigrant communities The Prime Minister has played the tough card on irregular migration but many feel he has not translated his strong words into remedial action on the ground “ Robert Abela ’ s words have raised expectations among voters that something will be done about migration and although police patrols have increased in some localities this does not appear enough to allay concerns ” a Labour activist said He noted that with jobs and incomes under threat people were more likely to take a negative view of migrants and foreigners a situation that could easily turn into a powder keg if mishandled More recently people with elderly relatives who died of COVID-19 or contracted the infection while in elderly homes are also angry at what they believe is government ’ s mishandling of the situation in care homes “ Generally people in these regions do not blame government for the surge in coronavirus cases but those who had elderly relatives contract the infection while living in care homes are angry at the lack of effective action shown by government in dealing with these institutions ” the same Labour activist said But there also appears to be a more local problem linked to the way Abela unceremoniously dumped veteran 2nd District MP Joe Mizzi from his Cabinet last January Mizzi who has been elected to parliament in every election since 1987 was the third Labour candidate to get elected from the 2nd District after Joseph Muscat and Helena Dalli in the last general election Muscat and Dalli have since resigned their seat in parliament leaving the district without a minister Chris Agius who was also elected from the district serves as parliamentary secretary “ Joe Mizzi is popular on the district and the way he was axed by the Prime Minister for no apparent reason has left many party supporters with a sour taste ” a source close to the PL administration said How Abela will deal with these problems is not easy He inherited a government that was at its lowest ebb in January and shortly after faced a pandemic of global proportions Thrust in a prime ministerial role from day one with no chance to make mistakes Abela needs to reconnect his government with voters ’ concerns and aspirations Like his predecessor would attest taking care of the macro problems must not come at the expense of micro issues that concern people in their everyday lives,"['Żabbar', 'Fgura', 'Paola', 'Valletta', 'Marsa',

security detail for Joseph Muscat confirming that Camilleri had met middleman Melvin Theuma at least four times Camilleri claimed in the statement that he was scared of retribution from Schembri but the information he offered had corroborated his role as an unwitting go-between between his boss and Theuma From information this newspaper has gathered the former security detail was adamant in his statement that he was unaware when Schembri asked him to meet Theuma that the ensuing conversation would turn to a request for bail for the Degiorgio brothers Theuma turned State ’ s evidence in December 2019 after being arrested on a money laundering charge the event precipitated the arrest of Tumas magnate Yorgen Fenech the businessman accused masterminding the assassination of Caruana Galizia Theuma has said he was commissioned by Fenech – a shareholder in the Electrogas power plant – to organise the hit on the journalist whose work uncovered the existence of 17 Black a Dubai company Fenech owned and was clearly connected to an offshore Panama company owned by Keith Schembri MaltaToday understands that in his statements Camilleri describes in detail that in 2018 months after the arrest of Vincent Muscat ‘ il-Kohhu ’ and the Degiorgio brothers – accused of carrying out the car bomb that killed Caruana Galizia – he was sent by Keith Schembri to speak to Melvin Theuma Camilleri said that he was asked by Schembri to ‘ calm him Theuma down ’ “ Camilleri said that Schembri called him on Whatsapp in the evening and told him to go to Theuma to calm him down ” sources told MaltaToday Camilleri drove to Zurrieq together with Yorgen Fenech ’ s business associate Johann Cremona although he claims to having not known why he had to tell Theuma to ‘ calm down ’ But Camilleri also stated that Theuma had then told him to tell Schembri to arrange for bail for the Degiorgio brothers “ Camilleri said that as soon as Theuma told him that he panicked claiming he had no idea Theuma was going to talk to him about the Degiorgio brothers He said he tried calling Schembri but he hung up on him as he was in a meeting ” In court in the compilation of evidence against Fenech Melvin Theuma has corroborated part of this version of events having claimed that Keith Schembri had “ panicked and sent Kenneth to calm me down ” when he was attempting to convince Joseph Muscat ’ s chief of staff to secure bail for the Degiorgio brothers George and Alfred Theuma has insisted in court that it was Camilleri who told him to inform the Degiorgio brothers that they would be granted bail and given €1 million each He described Camilleri as being close to Schembri having been sent by the former chief of staff to meet him in person But in the statements released by Camilleri the former security officer claims the first time he met Theuma had been in an unsolicited approach outside the Auberge de Castille in Valletta Camilleri was then exiting the prime minister ’ s car when Theuma approached him asking him for his mobile number But Camilleri not knowing who Theuma was did not give him his number Camilleri said he later got to know about Theuma from Johann Cremona who told him that he had a taxi stand at Portomaso In another meeting Camilleri had with Theuma was outside the Maltese Parliament where he was on duty and was called by Johann Cremona “ Camilleri said he had been asked to meet up for a coffee with Cremona and out of nowhere Theuma appeared and started to talk about bail for the Degiorgio brothers According to Camilleri Theuma would have said they should give them two ‘ big bags ’ possibly cash… Camilleri was adamant that Cremona never call him up again ” The statements reveal the extent to which throughout 2018 and 2019 Schembri – Joseph Muscat ’ s right-hand man – was aware of what had happened in October 2017 while the then prime minister was busy building a personal campaign in Europe to take the top post of president of the European Council Theuma has previously claimed in court that the Degiorgios had reached out to the former economy minister Chris Cardona with a bail request as well Testifying during the compilation of evidence against murder suspect Yorgen Fenech in February 2020 Theuma “ If anyone could help them Cardona knew all of the judges Mario had told me that Cardona had ignored them over the bail though They had sent him a message to him over the bail but he ignored them ” Phone conversations The claims were based on Theuma ’ s mobile phone recordings of conversations he had had with Fenech as well as with his associate Johann Cremona The trove of clandestine recordings however also feature long conversations in which Theuma and Cremona flesh out a plan by the middleman to request a pardon apparently in a bid to avoid a money laundering charge that was worrying Theuma The recordings contain information that show Theuma was leaked information in 2019 that could have only come from top police brass or people high up in Castille with inside knowledge of the Caruana Galizia investigation Theuma for example was aware that Vincent Muscat had requested a pardon for information on the journalist ’ s assassination in April 2018 by offering up his name as a middleman in the murder In September 2019 Johann Cremona had learnt that Muscat would be made to recant the information he gave to the police – an event that never came to pass and which appears to have informed the relinquishing of his brief by long-time lawyer Arthur Azzopardi The conversations suggest that Muscat ’ s mentioning of Theuma back in 2018 led to the money laundering investigation that the middleman was anxious about Cremona also is heard in the conversations praising Schembri for protecting Theuma “ Forget Yorgen… it ’ s not Keith who harmed you It ’ s that bastard Arthur… in reality he Keith protected you he didn ’ t sleep on it because as I can make the story out… Keith is not confused Keith is focused ” The two men appeared confident that pressure from Interpol on the FIAU file on Theuma would be diverted by Commissioner of Police Lawrence Cutajar Theuma was so determined not to be arrested on the feared money laundering charge that he is told by Cremona to impart on Yorgen Fenech the importance of speaking to Keith Schembri about the matter “ I will be clear ” Cremona says “ I ’ ll say ‘ Listen Kenneth don ’ t call me on Melvin He is determined that he will not be picked up by the police If they raid him he will reveal everything he knows ”,['Valletta'],"[(3254, 3262, 'LOC')]"

tightening the noose around Muscat?",23/09/2020 11:49,To secure his election as Labour leader Robert Abela promised continuity with the Joseph Muscat era but his administration sent strong signs of discontinuity The latest development sees the police investigating Keith Schembri and Nexia BT over money laundering following the conclusion of a magisterial inquiry requested by former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil In what must have been a shock to Joseph Muscat loyalists who never doubted Schembri ’ s innocence Schembri was arrested in his own home on Tuesday morning at 1230am – interestingly it was One TV which first reported the dynamics of the home arrest Is this a sign of Abela reacting to force majeure or does he smell an opportunity to consolidate his leadership The evidence suggests that it is a bit of both Abela is on a trajectory which takes him away from Muscat but his pace is being set by events Despite his cautious approach Abela managed to carry out what increasingly looks like a silent revolution In the space of eight months he has effectively changed the political landscape in a way which would have looked unthinkable just a few months ago Abela ’ s silent revolution The more qualified Angelo Gafà has now replaced disgraced police commissioner Lawrence Cutajar The party has expelled Konrad Mizzi from the parliamentary group and has elected Daniel Jose Micallef as deputy leader a young politician with no skeletons in his closet instead of Chris Cardona Victoria Buttigieg has also replaced Attorney General Peter Grech Neville Gafà a close ally of Schembri has had his OPM job terminated Nationalist MEP David Casa reported that the Maltese authorities filed a complete request for information on Yorgen Fenech ’ s secret company 17 Black with the UAE authorities The government stopped silly antics like removing flowers from the Daphne Caruana Galizia makeshift shrine in Valletta The cherry on the cake was news on Monday that the criminal court had instructed the entire host of Malta ’ s financial institutions asset managers and investment fund managers to grant access to police investigators to any assets they hold in the name of Keith Schembri the former chief of staff to ex-prime minister Joseph Muscat as well his family This was a clear sign that the police and the Attorney General have finally embarked on an investigation on Schembri a decision which casts a dark shadow on Abela ’ s predecessor Muscat who had placed Schembri at the heart of the Maltese State Actions speak louder than words Abela has not expressed any political judgement on the Muscat era He has so far failed in encouraging any party discussion to assess the Muscat legacy The closest to expressing a political judgement was the expulsion of Konrad Mizzi from the parliamentary group but even this action was surgical and presented as a way of protecting the party from the Montenegro wind farm scandal Abela ’ s approach is one which lets the institutions tighten the noose around Muscat allies who up to a few months were considered untouchables This also indirectly increases the pressure on Muscat to give up his seat in parliament In this way without irking Muscat ’ s supporters by offending their idol Abela has taken away the carpet from under Schembri Mizzi and ultimately Muscat ’ s feet While doubts persist on whether Abela will if need be also throw Muscat under the bus so far his actions have been carried out with surgical precision in a way which avoids shedding blood What is clear is that Abela is doing nothing more than what is expected of any EU leader but his actions still amplify the contrast with his predecessor The downside is that Abela will not do more than the bare minimum of what is expected of him something which makes it unlikely for him to embark on a full-scale investigation of the deals involving Schembri Muscat and Mizzi This may also explain why Abela is wary of the public inquiry on Daphne Caruana Galizia ’ s assassination which has increasingly assumed the role of a forum investigating the Muscat system of government By sounding reservations on the scope of the inquiry Abela still pays lip service to Muscat loyalists by refusing to extend the public inquiry on Caruana Galizia ’ s assassination beyond December Abela seems wary of a judicial inquiry pronouncing a judgement on the Muscat years He also refrains from one symbolic step which would go a long way in healing wounds that of paying homage to Daphne Caruana Galizia at her murder site in the same way as EU Council President Charles Michel did a week ago Will Robert throw Joseph under the bus While never questioning Muscat ’ s legacy any investigation of Keith Schembri ’ s financial undertakings is bound to cast Muscat in a negative light While any public criticism of Muscat would sound premature to Labour loyalists any confirmation of allegations first made by former PN leader Simon Busuttil under the watch of a Labour government would inevitably diminish Muscat in the eyes of his supporters But Abela will not be the one to wield the dagger of Brutus in front of Muscat Pressure is bound to increase on Muscat to move aside Abela has now cornered Muscat whose resignation from parliament will inevitably be viewed as an admission of guilt It remains to be seen whether Abela will agree to sugar-coat Muscat ’ s bitter pill by heaping praise on his predecessor or whether he will let his silence speak volumes A new mandate for Abela Abela knows that taking action on Schembri will strengthen his appeal among middle of the road voters who still consider Labour as more stable than the opposition but want closure on the corruption scandals of the past years Decisive action against Schembri could also be a prelude for an early election which would give Abela the legitimacy required to break with the Muscat past For till now Abela has inherited Muscat ’ s mandate To disavow the legacy of his flawed predecessor he may well need a mandate of his own,['Valletta'],"[(1858, 1866, 'LOC')]"

money laundering it retains clout inside the international Financial Action Task Force FATF where the Moneyval assessment will be reviewed According to information gathered by MaltaToday the US government is interested in getting the green light from Malta for a Status of Forces Agreement as well as winning closer cooperation on intelligence to tackle the problem of arms and drug trafficking at Hurd ’ s Bank a security challenge that is high on the American agenda for Malta Malta and the United States government are edging closer the SOFA deal which is key towards enhanced interception of the smuggling routes around Hurd ’ s Bank an offshore bank to Malta ’ s east that is used to bypass US sanctions on illegal transhipments Various ministers are concerned that Malta ’ s problems on money laundering prosecutions which are needed to pass the all-important Moneyval test that starts in October could force it to conceded on a red line on the SOFA the issue of jurisdiction on US personnel based in Malta The Americans are said to be insisting on “ concurrent jurisdiction ” that is a system where both American and Maltese courts have jurisdiction But the Maltese are jittery about the demand a situation that would lead to both parties quibbling over having any prospective criminal case heard in the court they perceive will be most favourable to them The US has actively encouraged Maltese requests for United Nations Security Council sanctions against fuel smugglers which also used the national oil storage tanks to store smuggled Libyan fuel but while sanctions enforcing Libyan embargo rules would grant the US a route to easily board ships it suspects of carrying smuggled oil and weapons a SOFA would mean having American naval muscle in its backyard to deal with such situations Apart from winning greater US monitoring on Hurd ’ s Bank the Americans are demanding that the Chinese embassy in Pembroke is literally cut down to size The Chinese embassy wants to rebuild its headquarters here on a 19000 square metre plot in Pembroke The Chinese government had purchased the land from the Maltese government for €78 million in 2015 after the decision was approved by both sides of parliament The Chinese had first approached the Nationalist administration about the desired land back in 2007 requesting a 10000sqm are of land Since then the size has almost doubled Another request in which the US embassy is leaning on the Maltese government is to achieve a favourable resolution to the Steward Hospitals impasse Steward Healthcare founder and boss Ralph de la Torre have already locked horns with Prime Minister Robert Abela and health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne over the future of the hospitals ’ project and an agreement signed with former minister Konrad Mizzi Steward had a memorandum of understanding that was expected to be followed up by a new contract in 2019 but was never formally signed because of the political crisis that saw Muscat resign De la Torre was accompanied by a representative of the United States embassy in talks with Abela and Fearne last July The American healthcare company which stepped in to buy the mysterious Vitals Global Healthcare in December 2017 is insisting on a new contract that gives them more money to run the three state hospitals – up to €120 million annually – and wider berth on default clauses They had already won concessions from Muscat to ensure Steward gets extra finance to continue operations while in Malta The Maltese are already exposed to a new kind of risk on the Steward hospitals ’ concession information received by a magistrate carrying out an inquiry into the controversial public-private partnership revealed an “ escape clause ” that would turn any termination of the Steward concession into a government default The agreement was signed by Mizzi and Steward so that should the hospitals ’ concession be terminated by a court of law – for whatever reason and even if Steward is in breach of contract – such an event would be a government default That would mean that all debts incurred by Steward would be passed on to the government with the American company still be liable for a €100 million contractual pay-out for its equity One minister who spoke to MaltaToday referred to the influence of the US embassy as being “ impossible to ignore ” “ The Caruana Galizia assassination is intimately connected to shortcomings on rule of law which is itself tied to our Moneyval performance on money laundering The fact that someone like Yorgen Fenech is charged with the murder throws light on the Electrogas power plant as well ”,"['Pembroke', 'Pembroke']","[(2530, 2538, 'LOC'), (2660, 2668, 'LOC')]"

staff,03/09/2020 07:30,Several animal carcasses with faecal contamination were accepted for cutting in a slaughterhouse in which veterinary officials failed to “ correct the deficiency ” an audit by the European Commission ’ s Food Veterinary Directorate on the meat industry revealed Members of the audit team who witnessed the event had to intervene requesting the trimming of the affected areas with the task being swiftly carried out by the available personnel In their reply to the audit the Maltese authorities informed the EC that their veterinary support officers had been trained to check and identify and remove faecal contamination from carcasses The audit on abattoirs carried out between February and March found that Maltese veterinary authorities at all levels were “ seriously understaffed ” This weakened the effectiveness of official controls on matters like traceability of red meat and poultry meat the verification of cleanliness in establishments and microbiological testing of carcasses at slaughterhouses Additionally at the time of the inspection the posts of Chief Veterinary Officer and four out of five heads of unit were vacant at the lower level the tasks of several vacant posts were shared by available staff from different services without appropriate training “ As a consequence the frequency of inspections of food producing establishments based on the risk assessment of their activities can not be respected and relevant non-compliances with regard to regulatory requirements in all areas remain undetected for a long period of time ” The audit said that no supervision of veterinary officials took place to give the authorities “ a reasonable level of assurance that controls are carried out uniformly correctly and consistently and to allow it to take corrective actions if needed ” Supervision was limited to self-assessments and by some checks on the working documentation Furthermore not all officials had the sufficient knowledge or experience to perform adequate checks and no specific training was in place for staff given new responsibilities or to cover vacant posts Staff shortages do not only impact on the Veterinary Regulation Unit which is responsible for the implementation of food safety legislation in production processing transport and trade of food of animal origin but also health ministry ’ s environment health directorate which inspects butchers EHD representatives said staff shortages meant inspections of butchers were being performed at a much lower frequency than planned and do not always cover all items present in the inspection checklists Shortages blamed on Maltese language requirement The Maltese authorities blamed the staff shortages on the salary levels offered to junior veterinarians in the public sector and the Maltese language requirement to qualify for the post However this will be modified for candidates from abroad with newly recruited staff not fluent in the Maltese language granted one year to attend intensive language courses and undergo proficiency tests Still attempts to recruit more veterinarians were unsuccessful The last two competitions resulted in only one suitable candidate selected Another call in March 2020 selected two candidates one of whom declined the post Food safety procedures The system for approval of food producing establishments also showed shortcomings with all approval files seen by the audit team being “ largely incomplete ” It turns out that the competent authority does not keep the approval conditions for these establishment under regular review contrary to what is required by EU law In contrast the traceability of live cattle was deemed satisfactory due to the regular update of the National Livestock Database An efficient system is also in place for emergency slaughter at farms of animals unfit for transport This has dramatically reduced the number of animals deemed unfit for transport arriving at slaughterhouses Faeces found on carcasses The slaughterhouses visited had satisfactory structures and equipment The main slaughterhouse and cutting plant in Marsa have been refurbished and equipped to acceptable standards even though still in need of some continuous maintenance Still the presence of middlemen in the cutting plant was still allowed and they were also permitted to cut their own carcasses In one case a “ rusty ” saw was used Officials in the slaughterhouses and cutting plants visited had documented no specific checks on carcass hygiene “ Several carcasses with faecal contamination had been accepted for cutting ” and veterinary officials did not react “ to correct the deficiency ” The audit team had to intervene requesting the trimming of the affected areas which was swiftly carried out by the available personnel In one meat-processing establishment the audit team noted the presence of dirty crates in cleaned working areas damaged wooden pallets in the cold store and the presence of expired ingredients for marinating meat “ On the first floor of this establishment where changing rooms toilets and boot washing facilities were located building works were still to be completed ” In the meat processing establishment visited a large amount of fresh and frozen cuts of pork beef and poultry were packed without traceability or labelling the date of freezing was also omitted Several pieces of meat products originating from other national establishments and seen in the cold store did not bear any labels or identification marks In the poultry slaughterhouse visited contrary to EU law a large amount of fresh and frozen cuts was packed without traceability or labelling and the date of freezing were also omitted In another case identified in the report no corrective actions had been documented following the appearance of three clusters of Salmonella on carcasses in 2019 Animals had to jump to the slaughter No particular issues were identified in respect of animal welfare at the slaughterhouse but regulatory requirements regarding animal welfare during transport especially those related to the suitability of vehicles are not verified by official controls During a visit to one of the two red meat slaughterhouses visited the audit team noted that three cattle from Gozo who had undergone travel by road and ferry of nearly three hours had been transported in a vehicle not suitable for transport of live animals This vehicle a truck not belonging to the farmer was normally used for the transport of bulk feeding stuff and was equipped for unloading its load by elevating its trailer The animals had to jump over the unloading ramp because the levels of the ramp and of the truck floor did not meet for more than 50 cm Both slaughterhouses had appropriate lairages with animals arriving the day of slaughter and provided with water Religious slaughter of farmed animals was also systematically carried out with prior stunning In fact slaughterhouses have adequate procedures for religious slaughter all cattle undergo prior stunning with captive penetrative bolt and were then killed by severing the whole throat Good records on the maintenance of stunning equipment were kept and stun-to-stick intervals were appropriate to ensure a satisfactory animal welfare Maltese government reaction The audit was part of a series planned across the EU in 2019 after media allegations of slaughter in several member states including Germany of cows unfit for human consumption and breaches in animal welfare rules during slaughter The Maltese government has now announced a series of measures to improve the situation including a revamp of supervision control and verification procedures A new officer was employed specifically to carry out veterinary duties in the public abattoir Quarterly audits on red meat and poultry slaughterhouses are also planned for 2020 but were postponed due to COVID-19 measures introduced by the Superintendent of Public

13:21,An investigation into Lino Cauchi ’ s mysterious disappearance only turned into a murder probe four years after his dismembered body was found in a Buskett well The delay was partly attributed to the time it took to identify the remains And yet just eight months after the gruesome find a foreign forensic expert roped in to assess the remains had suggested the victim was Cauchi Cauchi an accountant went missing on 15 February 1982 He never returned back to his Santa Venera home from his office in Valletta Two days later Cauchi ’ s briefcase was found abandoned and forced open in the vicinity of Chadwick Lakes It was empty But then on 15 November 1985 human body parts were discovered wrapped in black plastic bags in a well in the area known as Il-Bosk in Buskett In July 1986 forensic pathologist Iain Eric West from Guy ’ s Hospital in London had concluded that the remains were those of a man aged between 30 and 40 whose body had been dismembered by the use of hand and electric saws Cauchi was 32 when he disappeared three years earlier West had concluded that the victim was killed after receiving two blows to the sides of the head when still alive The blows by a mallet that was also found in the well fractured the man ’ s skull The pathologist could not determine whether the victim was alive when he received a third blow to the face The cause of death was given as cerebral lacerations and fractured skull Pathologist ’ s report But West ’ s report seen by MaltaToday added that from the facial reconstruction carried out at the time the skull was “ consistent with the facial features of a man named Paul Cauchi ” Lino ’ s actual name was Paulinos West however said identification of this nature was “ not ideal ” and suggested dental confirmation to improve accuracy “ But there is a clear resemblance between the photograph of Cauchi and the reconstruction which has been carried out on the deceased ’ s skull ” West concluded West ’ s report from July 1986 was not enough to direct investigations and the magisterial inquiry into a murder probe into Cauchi It was only two years later that further forensic tests carried out in Australia confirmed beyond doubt that the remains found in the well belonged to Cauchi In March 1989 then magistrate David Scicluna concluded his inquiry into the discovery of body parts at Buskett identifying the victim as Cauchi A month later Cauchi ’ s funeral took place and in July 1989 the Attorney General asked magistrate Scicluna to continue with the inquiry which now had to delve into the disappearance and murder of Cauchi It was only four years after his body was found and seven years after Cauchi ’ s disappearance that investigations turned into a murder probe Nobody has ever been charged with the brutal murder and Cauchi ’ s case remains a mystery to this day His widow Anna and their now 38-year-old son Paolo whom Cauchi never saw are now seeking compensation from the State In a constitutional case filed last week they claim Cauchi ’ s murder was facilitated by the violent political climate of the time But they also claim there was a lack of willingness to properly investigate the case over the years The fact that West ’ s report appears to have been given the cold shoulder is one instance flagged by Cauchi ’ s relatives as a sign of the authorities ’ reluctance to go deep enough Who was Cauchi Cauchi was an accountant to Piju Camilleri the right-hand man of then minister Lorry Sant the only politician to ever be charged with corruption – a case that ended up being time-barred Court testimony had placed Cauchi in at least two stormy meetings before the December election in 1981 where corrupt land deals were being discussed When Cauchi disappeared two months later he was in possession of potentially incriminating documents that were never found There is no evidence to link Cauchi ’ s disappearance with these corrupt land deals or the people involved in them Camilleri has always denied any link with Cauchi ’ s murder insisting he only got to know of his disappearance from the newspapers However an investigation carried out by MaltaToday in 2002 revealed how the day after Cauchi ’ s disappearance a man from the Inland Revenue Department had gone knocking on Anna Cauchi ’ s door asking for some important files The man was later revealed to be a certain Charles Zammit an acquaintance of the Cauchi family who had been doing the bidding of a top official at the department a certain Micallef known as ‘ Il-Mulej ’ In a renewed effort to carry on the investigation in 2002 the police interrogated Zammit but the man who sent him had by then passed away Nobody knows what information those files contained and why was it so important for an Inland Revenue official to go and pick them up less than 24 hours after Cauchi went missing Cauchi ’ s relatives claim in their constitutional application that this incident involving a tax official was never investigated properly by the police,['Valletta'],"[(501, 509, 'LOC')]"
https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/104270/analysis_robert_abelas_five_covid19_blunders,[ANALYSIS] Robert Abela’s five COVID-19 blunders,19/08/2020 13:20,1 Abela downplayed risk of second wave Robert Abela ’ s greatest mistake was to ignore experts ’ advice that the virus was still lurking waiting for the first opportunity to strike back and gave the impression that the war had already been won “ Waves are found in the sea there ’ s no need to strike up public fear of a second wave ” he said in May when announcing a lifting of restrictions Addressing the party ’ s general conference on 26 June he invited people to enjoy the Summer “ I had expressed my determination that people would enjoy the summer – and many said that we did not know what we were doing then ” he told the party faithful at an extraordinary general conference at the Rialto Theatre in Cospicua “ And I kept my word with you ” he added to a roaring applause Yet Chris Barbara an eminent virologist and part of the team leading Malta ’ s successful COVID-19 fightback had already warned in May that the virus “ will seize every opportunity we create for it to spread ” Prophetically he warned that “ this is surely not the time to organise street parties or to celebrate in this way as we will be creating more opportunities for the virus to spread ” and that “ now is the time to be even more careful than ever by keeping physical distance avoiding groups using sanitizer to wash hands and wearing facemasks ” Had the government heeded his advice by stopping mass gatherings parties and feast marches the situation may not have degenerated as much as it did 2 He overplayed the immigration card By closing the ports during the first pandemic emergency at the risk of endangering lives Abela raised expectations that he can stop immigrant boats from reaching Malta But he was also aware that he could not suspend international obligations indefinitely That did not stop him from further sabre-rattling with the EU over immigrants who were inhumanely detained on a Captain Morgan boat in April But this decision also backfired after Abela was snubbed by the EU and forced to bring the migrants to shore Yet despite these setbacks Abela continued playing the immigration card by suggesting that Malta ’ s high numbers are attributable to immigrants coming by boat On 3 August when asked to comment on whether there was a relationship between the spike in positive cases and a number of large-scale parties and gatherings Abela said he disagreed with attributing the surge in new cases to mass events as just under half of the numbers were rescued migrants who were being kept in isolation and did not mix within the community The problem for Abela is that his blame game has even backfired among immigrant-bashers who blame him for taking in more migrants despite all his bluster To add insult to injury the decision to quarantine immigrants on boats will mean that migrants will become another source of revenue for the fat cats bidding for their quarantine on the high seas 3 He backtracked without apologising Muscat excelled in the art of backtracking and recognising his own mistakes as he did in 2015 when he described his pushback threat in 2013 as a “ mistake ” In May 2019 Muscat apologised for controversial remarks on foreign workers saying that “ his vision was for foreign workers to toil in the sun instead of the Maltese ” was “ insensitive ” But Abela remained aloof refusing to take any blame for handling of the second COVID-19 emergency during which the number of active cases shot up from just three cases in July to over 600 cases a month later Unlike Muscat Abela failed to realise that a carefully crafted apology can go a long way in defusing criticism Instead Abela ’ s stubborn refusal to accept some blame for the situation betrays his aloofness from the suffering of thousands of old people who were expected to go on lockdown and who are now angry that his encouragement to people to enjoy the summer has practically nullified their sacrifice 4 He was too keen on appeasing the big lobbies The problem with the latest restrictions is that these hit hard on small businesses like bar owners who are now more likely to blame big party organisers and the hotel lobby for spoiling their recovery They may be keen to point out that had Abela not succumbed to these lobbies and restricted travel to tourists with COVID-free certificates and had he kept restrictions on mass gatherings in place we might well be in a much better situation than we are now While one has to acknowledge that Abela was in a tight spot facing mass lay-offs if business remained grounded he may have discovered that his rush to lift restrictions has now left everybody worse off In short he may well have taken a gamble which failed to pay off Moreover by not publishing the risk assessments which accompanied the lifting of measures Abela is leaving people in doubt whether he was really following expert advice One major problem for Abela is that he know finds himself politically damaged by his association with MHRA boss Tony Zahra who had branded COVID-19 cautiousness as ‘ Project Fear ’ or Fortina boss Michael Zammit Tabona who recently called on government to decrease the number of swab tests which he blamed for the spike in COVID-19 figures 5 He went on holiday when people wanted reassurance Political leaders are expected to provide leadership in their country ’ s moment of need Being here and leading the fightback is the least one would expect from a sitting Prime Minister in a country anxious about a spike in new cases He is also expected to lead by example and one may argue that non-essential travel is in itself a risky activity which is at best avoided But as Malta registered its highest ever batch of COVID-19 cases – 72 – Robert Abela was at the Marina di Ragusa in Sicily where he enjoys boating weekends on his personal boat Save for his quick return on Sunday to address Labour audiences on One TV Robert Abela was officially on holiday from the 11 August during the same days which saw record numbers of new cases To add insult to injury last Saturday the PM was pictured in Ragusa Sicily doing spinning classes as Malta suffered its highest ever increase in COVID-19 cases Abela ’ s nonchalance was contrasted with the resignation of Ireland ’ s national tourism authority Michael Cawley after Catherine Martin the Irish tourism minister expressed disappointment that Cawley had not acted in solidarity with the industry by flying to Italy when “ tourism and hospitality have suffered significant losses since the start of this pandemic ” When Chris Fearne shrugged off questions on Abela ’ s holiday while announcing new restrictions on businesses that rubbed more salt in the wound Not only did Fearne refrain from defending the indefensible… but he could not help laughing the questions off while saying “ If you keep asking the same questions you will receive the same answers ” on questions unrelated to COVID-19 Abela ’ s absence from that momentous press conference further boosted the stature of his leadership rival who was there to face the music and reassure the public in the country ’ s moment of need,['Cospicua'],"[(709, 717, 'LOC')]"
https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/104097/numbers_tell_a_different_story_its_the_state_that_must_not_neglect_migrants_and_our_communities,Numbers tell a different story: it’s the State that must not neglect migrants and our communities,19/08/2020 08:00,Why is immigration such an emotive issue for the Maltese Malta is a country governed by a centre-left government whose free market embrace has not come at the expense of the welfare programme – it increased pensions it gradually increased minimum wage it reduced energy bills removed exam fees pays for free childcare and school transport amongst many such universal services and welfare payments In spite of the robust economy and near full employment the Maltese still rate immigration as one of their major concerns – especially Labour voters The last MaltaToday survey alone rated immigration the top concern 142 down by half from 32 in November 2019 But it was a major concern for Labour voters 183 and those living in the south almost 19 Some of these concerns are related to direct living impacts for example people who live in proximity to migrant communities in Hamrun Marsa Hal Safi or Birzebbugia – their experience as neighbours is different to that experienced by others whose encounter with African migrants is as consumers or recipients of public services such as garbage collection That experience can be aggravated in areas where migrants are unemployed exploited by the construction and other industries live in crowded apartments are driven to criminality by a precarious existence or have mental health problems But Malta ’ s racism problem is spoken about less than its immigration problem African migrants rank the lowest in our perception of foreigners we say little to nothing about legal workers from the East of Europe or Asia because we accept them as valid candidates for jobs the Maltese no longer seem available to do – such as in nursing or caring or in catering and hospitality among many others Middle Eastern workers hailed for their construction skills also seem to be in good stead even though the far-right goes nuts when it sees an expression of Muslim worship It is black migrants who have it worse and that ’ s because they are starting from a position of illegality not all of them qualify for asylum which makes a sizeable portion of migrants technically ‘ unwanted ’ and legally speaking slated for removal from the country even though this does not happen But then this pool of usually unskilled or semi-skilled labour can not transition seamlessly into a state of legality because they arrive to Malta already delegitimised They are i prone to being unemployed or do temporary and ad hoc jobs for low pay ii they could be homeless or living in overcrowded cheap housing in places close to Valletta and Floriana where police and immigration controls are located and Hamrun and Marsa where the migrant reception is located and is the major pick-up point for ad hoc work and iii stuck in a cycle of poverty and its associated social and health problems They are the least likely to integrate without a generous push from the State and the community to help them on And yet it is clear that the Maltese prefer scapegoating this community without batting an eyelid on the crimes of those who rule over them or who acquire public land at a pittance Reality about numbers Let ’ s talk about the numbers how much is too much for Malta The emergency of irregular migrant arrivals is not artificial A government source says the number of migrants residing in reception facilities both closed and open is over 3500 – half of which arrived just in 2020 The Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers AWAS also supports an additional 720 migrants through public-private collaborative projects 2019 was already a record year for migrant arrivals by boat in Malta 3405 – the second highest was 2775 in 2008 the year before Silvio Berlusconi paid Muammar Gaddafi €5 billion to stop boat departures It ‘ worked ’ in 2010 just 47 arrived in Malta Then war broke out in Libya and the numbers went back up After the 2013 Lampedusa tragedy the Mare Nostrum operation rescued hundreds of thousands to Italy and Malta ’ s arrivals were negligible till 2018 These numbers are problematic for a host of services - army detention services social workers asylum reception centres and asylum determination officers - who are tasked to rescuewelcometend toprocess them Of less concern are foreigners whose legality does not create an obligation on the State and community… irrespectively of how many thousands flow into Malta to the consternation of nobody From 2011 onwards foreign workers in Malta increased from around 13000 to 67500 31000 are non-EU nationals – year on year this was an average growth of 5800 new foreign workers a year from both EU and non-EU The biggest non-EU groups are Filipinos 5300 Serbians 4600 and Indians 4300 The largest EU group is Italian 10000 Nobody complains much about Italian café-owners and pastry-makers Filipino nurses and nannies Serbian contractors and Indian bus drivers Certainly nothing that warrants their annihilation as some egregious social media antagonists say The non-EU or Third Country Nationals TCNs are clearly filling particular labour gaps in Malta the majority 8800 are in support service jobs while the rest are mainly in construction 4100 and retail 4000 or nursing and caring 3700 Within these types of jobs few of them occupy high-level positions they are mainly in elementary positions 10000 or sales workers 6800 To the contrary EU workers are mainly managers 5000 professionals 6400 technicians 5300 or support workers 7400 Here you see the difference between these legal workers EU usually skilled workers come for major desk jobs the TCNs do lower-end though extremely useful jobs and heavy lifting It seems here that our social pact with these tens of thousands of foreign workers is clear they pay taxes and rent If they stay on for 20 years maybe they will get to be citizens Is it crime and security the Maltese are worried about The Maltese tend to be particularly vocal about foreigners ’ crimes which is why Paceville brawls between Eastern European staff and Syrian clubbers conjure up images of a “ jungle ” or crimes by Africans are met with a clamour for deportation orders It would seem logical to placate such calls with some form of banishment from the country however it does little to address the reality of criminality amongst down-and-out and homeless migrants There is no question that in the towns that host the largest communities of African migrants there are serious complaints of anti-social behaviour criminality and security When such people are “ delegitimised ” upon arriving to Malta there is no case for a social pact with them Delegitimised because these are not workers answering job calls on LinkedIn They depart Libya through the organisation of a criminal enterprise their rescue at sea does not come with open arms because European states refuse to save migrants due to populist anxieties on opinion polls and electoral results the politicisation of NGOs who are challenging this normalisation of non-rescue is used to justify populist anxieties ‘ if the State leaves them to die why are these NGOs not allowing us to leave them die ’ In this state of emergency the migrants become further delegitimised by the logistical headache that their rescue - mandated though it is by international law and human rights - puts on a host of government agencies For these visa-less unwanted migrants illegal entry is necessary to the host state it is disorderly undeserving and intrusive There is also a reality many critics enjoy latching on to That many asylum claimants might not be refugees but simply ‘ economic migrants ’ … much like the EU workers and TCNs who work here except that irregular migrants come “ uninvited ” and with no documents in hand How many refugees and other migrants from Africa In the record 2019 year when over 3400 were brought into Malta over 4000 asylum claims were filed But that year the Maltese agency for international protection the refugee commission only managed to process just over 1000 Of these 633 60 were rejected – technically these people are handed a deportation order which however is hard to carry out due to the lack of documentation and bureaucratic complications with the country of return The highest form of protection refugee status was given to 48 people globally thousands upon thousands of refugees are displaced within their own countries or in neighbouring states and the few that make it to Malta have very particular cases of proven persecution back home Another 359 were given subsidiary protection which gets renewed every three years and only until such time these people can return safely to their country of origin And historically this is the picture of asylum in Malta every year in the last 12 years the islands gave refugee protection on average to 100 people subsidiary protection to 963 people a year and rejections to 520 people every year Deporting rejected asylum seekers instantly might go some way in placating a certain ‘ anti-immigrant ’ anger But it will not stop this racism manifesting itself to Africans in Malta whose education status lack of skills or poverty and the psychological problems these bring makes it impossible for them to enter a state of “ legitimacy ” through legal work decent pay and housing How many still in Malta What we might not know for sure is how many asylum seekers are in Malta Since 2008 we had a total of 12700 granted some form of protection and 6200 asylum claims rejected But then you have to subtract the number of people resettled to the United States 3000 and those to the EU 1548 Historically it could mean that as many as 15000 of migrants who arrived in Malta illegally are living here The data from the 2004-2007 period is not included here However Jobsplus records have only 3173 asylum seekers and asylum beneficiaries in gainful employment as at 2019 These are not just refugees or people with subsidiary protection - they probably include rejected asylum seekers The government has never tracked the movements of these migrants of which many attempt to leave and enter the EU through false documents Is Malta still hosting another 12000 migrants all somehow part of the black job market who have never left the island to move on to the EU Not impossible but somehow not entirely plausible The Maltese claim that the African underclass is a threat if not ‘ culturally ’ then economically But Jobplus numbers disprove that in 2019 those who hailed from the sub-Sahara who were in employment were Eritreans 338 Nigerians 415 Somali 407 and Ethiopians 147 - 1307 That is hardly job-stealing figures The Maltese just seem less preoccupied with those who require no dependence on the State although legal workers in Malta get free healthcare and education certainly culture and even race play a part in this affinity But when we see these numbers the dystopian future presented by Maltese far-rightists and racists is clearly untrue There are no numbers which suggest Malta will be “ overtaken ” by Somalis Eritreans or Sudanese – technically we are more likely to be overtaken by Italian café-owners and English “ ex-pats ” Foreign workers grow by 5000 every year The comparison is easy to make since 2008-9 foreign workers grew by 5000 each year on average asylum claims grew by 1500 each year on average The latter class is delegitimised by illegal entry arrives and stays in poverty and is then condemned by racism to be stuck in various forms of precarity But immigration does matter And governments that do not give in to right-wing anxieties must still counter concerns on immigration and confront the problem it faces MaltaToday surveys on concerns reflect similar concerns in Europe where immigration remains one of the most important issues facing their countries However far-right groups claiming that immigration changes their country or their culture ignore the fact that Maltese businesses have a huge demand for cheap labour that the Maltese will no longer supply Instead of addressing the effects of unbridled development on their quality of life immigrants are easy scapegoats because of otherwise valid problems of bad neighbourliness or social precarity But these problems must be addressed by police and the State ’ s social agencies That is their job The economic concerns are certainly overstated Elementary and unskilled jobs are occupied by non-EU workers as the data shows Maltese workers in low-skill jobs are finding competition from legal workers or in the case of tradesmen even from EU-based small business owners who expand in Malta But in times of COVID-19 uncertainty where jobs will be lost citizens are likely to be resentful of newcomers “ jumping the queue ” or strangers requesting asylum Certainly a big part of this response is tied to the way public services are designed to cater for migrant arrivals When reception centres and AFM maritime rescue efforts are overwhelmed by large numbers the “ emergency ” perception will be felt strongly by citizens especially those communities who live closest to these people or who fear job competition in any shape of form Certainly enough addressing social problems in immigrant communities and the material concerns of their host neighbours is a duty of the State a serious challenge to be seen to actively Because when these complaints are communicated especially on social media by ‘ Ryan Fenech ’ videos or the angry far-right rants of zookeeper Anton Cutajar the response becomes problematic they are in the first place dangerous expressions of incitement because these “ emotive ” interlocutors also have incorrect views on migration But it is a mistake to assume an ‘ elitist ’ stance by calling the outbursts “ backward ” We do need experts entering the fray And that will mean an entire host of new communicators who are not only busy working with migrants but also with the communities that host them Addressing the concerns of those who resent African migration and the social problems it brings does not mean normalising racism But it is certainly a challenge for both State and parties The government which does not address security concerns inside towns with both police and social workers is allowing citizens to shoulder the burden that comes from irregular migration and a political party which does not provide a response on immigration that is positive and unique only gives in to the scaremongering of the far-right,"['Marsa', 'Safi', 'Valletta', 'Floriana', 'Marsa']","[(878, 883, 'LOC'), (888, 892, 'LOC'), (2534, 2542, 'LOC'), (2547, 2555, 'LOC'), (2621, 2626, 'LOC')]"
https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/104231/five_hurdles_bernard_grech_is_facing_to_win_over_floaters_to_the_pn,Five hurdles Bernard Grech is facing to win over floaters to the PN,18/08/2020 08:03,The latest MaltaToday survey conducted among PN members before other potential candidates like Roberta Metsola and Therese Comodini Cachia withdrew their interest in the leadership clearly shows that Bernard Grech was not simply the choice of the rebel MPs in a chess move against Adrian Delia His candidature was already making waves in the party ’ s grassroots before the internal opposition settled on his name By clearing the field for him the parliamentary group is responding to the aspirations of party members who have shown more trust in Grech than Delia across all electoral districts and overwhelmingly strong in both the Labour-leaning fifth district which includes Birzebbugia and Zurrieq and the tenth district which includes Sliema and St Julian ’ s Significantly he is accepted across the PN ’ s internal class divide with members with different levels of education backing him over Delia The high trust levels enjoyed by Grech across electoral districts and age groups and the perception that he is the most likely to bring about unity suggest that is likely to win the contest with Delia But what hurdles does he face once elected 1 His party is seen as a lame duck Bernard Grech takes over a party considered as having practically no chance of winning the next election While the party may hope that it could narrow the gap with Labour the perception that a party with little chance of winning makes a recovery is even more unlikely And this weakens the party ’ s appeal not just among voters but also amongst potential candidates who would only sacrifice their professional career by jumping on a winning cart This weakens the party ’ s appeal to donors and funders who don ’ t invest in a party with no future To succeed Grech needs to ditch the perception that his party is a lost cause One advantage is that surveys indicate he can heal the PN divide to present the electorate with a united front Without that the PN starts at a disadvantage Re-compacting the Nationalist bloc Grech could bank on a polls surge with the return of PN voters previously undecided on whether to vote which could also generate a a ripple effect on the wider electorate What Grech can not afford at this stage is losing Delia loyalists offsetting gains made with other PN voters That is why Grech needs to win fairly and squarely and keeping him on board any exclusion of Delia would backfire on Grech Even if Grech recovers all PN voters in 2017 he will still lose the election with the same margin as Simon Busuttil That ’ s why it is vital for Grech to keep traction moving from compacting the Nationalist vote to winning over floaters and Labour voters Polls will be a challenge for Grech as they register his progress or cripple perceptions without giving him enough time to take difficult decisions in the party ’ s long-term interests 2 His front bench is weak and lacks diversity Grech never served as an MP and lacks experience in party structures He would take over a party with a limited talent pool in key areas like science economy finance and social policy The party also needs greater diversity as it is too associated with middle-aged white heterosexual male lawyers – just like Grech a lawyer to boot He would need a team that has the semblance of a government in waiting and unfortunately for him the MPs he inherits are not just demoralised but also poor in both quality and diversity To succeed Grech needs to co-opt a new generation of party spokespersons from outside parliament to assist his shadow cabinet This may prove tricky and could be perceived as a threat to sitting MPs 3 Grech must make it clear he is in for the long haul Grech will have to dispel the perception that he is simply holding the pieces together until a new leader is elected after the inevitable defeat of the party in the next election To give Labour a run for its money he will have to restore the PN ’ s own financial fortunes without being slavishly bankrolled by big business an arduous route that requires a wave of enthusiasm from the moment he gets elected The key to his success will be his gravitas which could earn him the respect of rival factions If he is loved feared and respected in equal measure he may well succeed where his predecessors failed 4 Liberals are uneasy with his anti-divorce baggage Grech ’ s first foray in national politics was on the losing side of the divorce referendum Now he is keen to emphasise that he has changed his opinion over a number of years during which he found himself filing applications for divorce on behalf of clients Grech is bound to face questions on his judgement in opposing such a civil right which is considered basic in practically the whole world His declarations in 2011 are bound to return to haunt him especially in those instances where his opposition to divorce seemed moulded in an ideological conservatism one of them was his suggestion that remarried spouses should not contest court orders preventing them from ‘ exposing ’ their children to their new “ same or opposite sex ” partners He now makes a distinction between his stance as a private individual in the 2011 referendum and his new role as politician where he has an obligation “ to look at many other aspects and not only the details and difficulties with the legal articles themselves ” Grech is aware of the need to strike a balance between conservatives and liberals in the PN arguing that while it is “ good to have liberal ideas and thoughts one must also have wisdom and the need to really work for the good of the country and not for the good of the few ” This suggests he is keen on presenting himself as an ‘ en-lightened conservative ’ someone who can be flexible and compassionate but ready to press the brakes to ensure that change is accompanied by deliberation But does Grech still associate the common good with the State ’ s role as enforcer on moral issues or is he limiting himself to themes like the environment and social justice where the State intervenes without infringing on personal life choices Grech may console himself with the way Joseph Muscat was absolved by the electorate on his previous anti-EU membership stance Like EU membership equal marriage and divorce are now both a done deal which can not be reversed The problem for Grech is his disposition towards liberal reforms like cannabis legalisation which may still be in the pipeline And while Robert Abela may be less keen than Muscat consider venturing towards abortion legalisation Grech may find him-self tested by a more pluralistic civil society which includes activists who agree with him on defending the common good in the case of environmental and social issues but favour personal autonomy and freedoms Grech will have to decide how pluralistic the PN can be on these issues Any political leader has to live with a reality where although most PN voters are to various degrees conservative the party can not win without voters who are to various degrees liberal Alienating a cohort who could potentially vote PN on the basis of other is-sues like the economy and good governance would be suicidal especially in the absence of an overriding battle-cry like EU membership which had kept the coalition of liberals and conservatives united 5The party lacks a compelling vision He needs to spell it out Delia never managed to set the tone for his vision His most notable stands were trying to turn the MEP elections into some abortion referendum and lambast the island ’ s economic dependency on foreign workers Yet even these positions were not articulated in a cohesive narrative Grech ’ s first declarations suggest that the defence of the “ common good ” is his starting point but that association with the 2011 anti-divorce campaign could rankle The theme has to be expanded to good governance the protection of the countryside and other resources and the duty to ensure the sustainability of free healthcare and pensions for future generations Grech will face questions on how far he will be willing to restrain market forces to protect the common good the PN has often found itself running with the hares and hunting with the dogs in the very rare occasions where Labour tried to restrain market forces as was recently the case with the rent laws where the party opposed the enforcement powers granted to the Housing Authority Grech ’ s vision needs experts from various fields who can give the party a sense of gravitas in its dealings with civil society Once again this depends on the party ’ s ability to appeal to technocrats to flesh out a vision and even that depends on whether Grech gains traction in the polls in the months to come Only progress can save the party from being shunned and ostracised,['Sliema'],"[(740, 746, 'LOC')]"

17-year-old Nagm Arbab fled Sudan in search of safety as the situation in his home country escalated to the point where he had no choice other than to leave Up until that point he was living in “ sort of ” peace with his family “ I had a normal life like many other teenagers – I would go to school hang out with friends But then the situation in Sudan began to deteriorate forcing me to leave my family and village ” says the 23-year-old man one of several black activists present at the Black Lives Matter rally in Valletta last Monday held in memory of Lassana Cisse shot in a drive-by shooting by two soldiers in 2019 Today Arbab studies industrial electronics at the University of Malta When he is not studying he works as an electrician But at such a young age this man ’ s journey to safety has been rife with danger “ First I went to another place in Sudan that was considered safe but eventually even the situation in that village deteriorated At that point I felt I had no choice but to leave my country altogether ” he says From Sudan Arbab crossed into Chad and then the Sahara desert setting course for Libya where he stayed for seven months in the hope that the country was on its way to regain stability from the civil conflict that ousted Muammar Gaddafi “ It was in chaos and because I once again had no choice I crossed the Mediterranean and arrived in Malta on 21 July 2014 I still remember the day ” For the teenage Arbab detainment at the Safi closed detention centre was hard “ I can say I am more fortunate than others because I was given opportunities I think I had it easier than other migrants and refugees But I still faced difficulties when it came to integrating as well as navigating a new country Which I think is normal and something many people who move countries go through ” After being released from detention Arbab was quick to understand the lack of organised community relations for Sudanese migrants when he saw migrants bringing food or cigarettes to migrants in detention “ I wanted to help migrants the same way they had helped me but there was no organisation to help bring the Sudanese together as a community where we could gather Until that point you had to approach people individually meeting at their place or in public So I thought there was a need for us to have a place we could gather and collaborate ” His Facebook page called out for Sudanese migrants to come together and share experiences and find a place to “ have some peace of mind and rest after a hard day ’ s work ” The Sudanese Migrant Association would soon take shape Today as the SMA ’ s vice-president Arbab is active as ever in the anti-racist manifestations that connect many Maltese and non-Maltese alike such as last Monday ’ s Black Lives Matter demonstration “ I think after personally witnessing racism here in Malta you can say we are more similar in some cases to America than most people realise We suffer from a lot of micro-aggressions I ’ ve witnessed racist behaviours – some intentional others perhaps not – and in my opinion no government body comes out to speak clearly about racism or address the reality of what is going on People tend to avoid the situation or use it for political gain ” Arbab said And despite countless cases of racism and even violence reported to the SMA Arbab says none of the victims get justice “ Things have become harder and racism has become clearer with public hate speech growing – platforms such as Facebook have played a role in that… to the point where the Hal Far centre has become less safe Before Lassana was murdered there was a hit-and-run outside the open centre of a 17-year-old boy from Chad He was left unconscious on the side of the road ” he says of May Malimi who was left unconscious on the side of Triq il-Ġebel in Hal Far with a fractured collarbone after being run over by a car Arbab says the death of Ivorian national Lassana Cisse shook the Sudanese community “ There was a lot of fear – fear that it could happen to them Some people thought they weren ’ t safe anymore and started limiting their activity during the night and only going out if necessary Some even began going out in groups of two so that if something happened to them the other would know People have calmed down slightly since then ” Now Arbab says the Black Lives Matter movement may have sparked a new voice for migrants and the anti-racist movement a new sign of courage for communities to no longer remain silent in the face of hate and racism “ We live in a community together – if someone is oppressed and the other remains silent the oppressed group will only grow more restless and will lead to a negative response from that group “ Malta is a small island If we ignore the problem of racism here it will only get worse and can escalate quickly ”,"['Valletta', 'Safi']","[(538, 546, 'LOC'), (1481, 1485, 'LOC')]"

https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/102596/analysis_delia_pn_fails_make_inroads_among_university_graduates,[ANALYSIS] Delia’s PN fails to make inroads among university graduates,28/05/2020 07:45,University-educated respondents to MaltaToday survey are shedding their political loyalties it seems They have shown themselves to be nearly four times more likely to abstain in a forthcoming election than those with a secondary level of education three times more than those with a post-secondary level of education and 12 times more than those with a primary level of education The fraction of non-voters – just one-tenth of voters on a national scale – rises to almost 20 among the university-educated suggesting higher levels of distrust in the political system from this cohort Nearly half or 44 said they won ’ t vote or are undecided whom to vote for compared to 26 with post-secondary and 16 with secondary levels of education This is a clear indication that the higher the level of education the weaker partisan loyalties are becoming In fact while 84 of those with secondary education are keen on voting either the PN or the PL the combined sum of both parties among the university-educated falls to just 54 Yet despite weakening political loyalties support for third parties among the university-educated remains very low at around 2 This suggests the only alternative considered to voting for either major parties is not to vote at all something that might reflect the absence of a viable third party which can attract these voters Since this educational group has been traditionally PN-leaning the high number of abstainers could also reflect the current distrust in Adrian Delia among a cohort of PN voters In fact this was also the only cohort to shift to the PN during the political crisis in December amidst a decline in non-committed voters from previous surveys However subsequently Labour strengthened its lead in this category of tertiary-educated voters This suggests that under Abela Labour has renewed its appeal among upwardly-mobile educated voters While in the middle of the December crisis the PN had overtaken the PL by 6 points in this category Labour has enjoyed a lead of between 14 and 22 points in all subsequent surveys Although the lead remains lower than the 30-point national lead Labour ’ s lead among the tertiary-educated remained consistent over the past five months Moreover the lowest percentage of non-committed university educated voters was registered in April when Labour also enjoyed a strong 22-point advantage in this group with its support reaching an all-time high of 41 This suggests that political loyalties among this group are fluid While during the political crisis in December a decline in non-committed voters had resulted in the PN overtaking Labour by six points among the tertiary educated cohort this was not the case in April when the number of non-committed voters was even lower What surveys seem to suggest is with the exception of a surge in December during Labour ’ s greatest crisis under Delia the PN has failed in making any inroads among the university-educated segment In fact in this segment the percentage of PN voters 20 is lower than both undecided voters 22 and non-voters 22 Support for the PN has oscillated between 17 and 20 in recent surveys since February a considerable decline since December when the PN scored 25 among the tertiary-educated On the other hand Labour ’ s support has oscillated between 33 and 41 Surveys also show that among the university-educated any decrease in the percentage of non-voters in this category corresponds to an increase in undecided voters rather than by any significant shift towards any of the two major parties For example a 16-point increase in non-voters between April and May was corresponded by a 10-point decrease in the percentage of undecided voters This suggests a tendency among the university-educated to shift between a clear resolve not to vote to a state of indecision on who to vote for the party ’ s leadership among this category Since the formation of the new government the percentage of non-voters among the university educated has oscillated between a 6 low in April and 32 in March while the percentage of undecided voters oscillated between 15 in March and 39 in February A regional analysis shows that the region with the highest percentage of non-committed voters is the more affluent north which includes St Paul ’ s Bay Mosta Mellieha and Naxxar In this region 31 of voters are either undecided or intent on not voting The region also boasts the highest percentage of voters intent on not voting 14 Although traditionally Nationalist-leaning Labour has made considerable inroads here in the past years In contrast the lowest percentage of non-committed voters is found in the Labour southeast where 15 are either undecided or intent on not voting Yet the survey also indicates a degree of discontentment in Labour ’ s strongholds in the south harbour region where 13 intend not voting and 27 are non-committal,"['Mosta', 'Naxxar']","[(4270, 4275, 'LOC'), (4289, 4295, 'LOC')]"
