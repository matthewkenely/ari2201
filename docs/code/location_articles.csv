"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday ’ s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia ’ s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “ I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day ” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “ are living in surreal times ” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “ greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country ” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country ’ s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “ a known fact ” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “ who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope ” including the Labourites “ who believed you ” he added turning his face to the government benches “ Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead ” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “ continuity ” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “ It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases ” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat ’ s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “ knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place ” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “ The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered ” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “ I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken ” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed,"['Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard', 'Attard',

Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “ at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice ” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “ criminal association to launder money originating from corruption ” Aquilina described it as a “ textbook case of money laundering ” Muscat ’ s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals ’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “ fraudulent ” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “ This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering ” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “ is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country ” “ From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath ” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “ remained silent and has not denied anything ”,['Valletta'],"[(274, 282, 'LOC')]"

Muscat received payments from Swiss firm that was previously called VGH Europe,"May 17, 2023 10:12 AM",Tista ' taqra bil Malti Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat received two payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group This has emerged from the corruption probe into Muscat as part of an investigation into potential corruption related to the Vitals Global Healthcare VGH deal The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “ fraudulent ” Muscat ’ s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe linked to the hospitals ’ deal according to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Investigators are probing whether a potentially bogus consultancy contract was drawn up to justify the €60000 in consultancy payments Muscat received from SpringX Media and Accutor Consulting which used to be called VGH Europe Although Muscat denies any link between the payments and Vitals the company ’ s name was changed to Accutor Consulting AG in January 2018 just before Steward Healthcare took over the hospitals ’ concession from VGH Muscat was paid a total of €60000 to his Bank of Valletta account in 2020 the first payment taking place just two months after he stepped down in January of that year The former prime minister received four monthly payments two from Accutor AG and two from Spring X Media another Swiss firm run by the same owner – Pakistani businessman Wasay Bhatti Spring X Media is registered at the same Swiss address as Accutor AG and the two companies carried out transactions between each other The Accutor AG payments to Muscat were made under the terms of an indefinite consultancy contract drawn up between himself and Spring X Media in February 2020 just one month after he resigned Despite the indefinite nature of the consultancy contract signed when Muscat was still an MP the payments ended abruptly in the summer of 2020 The contract was to earn Muscat €15000 a month for three years for a total of €540000 It was also to be automatically renewed for another three years before it was suddenly stopped after four monthly payments when Accutor went out of business Muscat ’ s residence was searched by police in January 2022 as a result of an inquiry anticorruption NGO Repubblika requested in 2018 But Muscat denied that the search had anything to do with his Accutor contract or suspicions that it was bogus and merely a vehicle to receive kickbacks from the hospitals ’ deal Likewise the reports say that former minister Konrad Mizzi ’ s home has also been searched as part of the probe and had his smartphone confiscated by police Transactions of Accutor AG the Swiss payroll company that played a key role in funnelling funds from VGHSteward and Bluestone show that the companies sent at least €7 million to Accutor which then directed payments toward VGH directors and behindthescenes investors According to his 2020 tax return Muscat declared an income of almost €482000 from various consultancy work in the year he resigned as prime minister The earnings were covered by a flurry of consultancy contracts Muscat signed in the weeks and months after resigning Following an unprecedented political and institutional crisis Muscat announced his resignation in December 2019 but actually resigned in January 2020 Muscat baulked under the pressure of weeks of protests following the the emergence of alleged links between government officials and the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and the arrest of Yorgen Fenech Fenech is awaiting a trial after being accused of masterminding the murder Moreover his Dubairegistered company 17 Black allegedly intended to funnel money to two Panama companies belonging to then energy minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat ’ s right hand man Keith Schembri According to The Times prime minister Robert Abela is wary of the inquiry ’ s outcome as he is concerned that highprofile arrests and possible prosecutions could throw the Labour Party into disarray Sources said police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police Moreover the investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella According to the reports Muscat claimed that he had been introduced to Bhatti “ years back ” by his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and that Bhatti got in touch with him “ after I announced my resignation ” “ Strongly refuting ” the allegations about the contract Muscat insisted that he has “ carried out legitimate and documented work in connection with my contract ” However when asked to provide any such documented evidence Muscat refused saying “ It is evidence that shows the projects I have been working on and meetings held “ I do not believe I should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities ” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “ everything was carried out accordingly ”,['Valletta'],"[(1482, 1490, 'LOC')]"

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office ’ s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela ’ s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat ’ s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday ’ s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela ’ s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “ blatantly false ” In making the party ’ s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO ’ s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “ the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place ” “ This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government ” Attard said describing the opposition ’ s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara ’ s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government ’ s conduct Deguara ’ s comment came in a section titled “ the failed attempts to revitalise the concession ” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “ After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process ” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “ government ’ s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession ” Deguara also went on to observe that the government ’ s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “ reflected poorly on the government ’ s management of the process ” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party ’ s reaction as “ hysterical ” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “ confused ” was also an apt descriptor of Labour ’ s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government ’ s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN ’ s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs ’ reactions to Abela ’ s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech ’ s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party ’ s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “ The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to
