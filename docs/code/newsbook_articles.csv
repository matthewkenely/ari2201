"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Tumuluri claims he was warned ‘he’d end up like Daphne’ by Keith Schembri,"May 17, 2023 6:55 PM",Former Vitals Global Healthcare direct Ram Tumuluri agreed to transfer the hospitals concession after receiving “death threats of ending up like Daphne Caruana Galizia” by former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s righthand man Keith Schembri Tumuluri made the claim in an official disclosure to the US authorities which was obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with partners in Malta The Shift and The Times of Malta The shocking claims come as Tumuluri wants whistleblower protection in the US to reveal alleged coercion threats and corrupt practices by disgraced firmer prime minister Joseph Muscat’s government in the hospitals deal According to the reports published on Wednesday evening Tumuluri filed a whistleblower complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act In his complaint Tumuluri alleged that he was repeatedly threatened by Schembri and others that he would meet the same end as journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia if he didn’t sign the hospitals’ concession over to Steward Healthcare The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Tumuluri claimed the threats were made by Schembri thenhealth minister Konrad Mizzi and one of the concession’s original brokers Shaukat Ali among others In March 2015 journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had first reported that the government had struck a deal with Oxley Capital Group of Singapore ahead of the call for proposals for the privatisation of three of Malta’s state hospitals and that representatives of the company – including Ram Tumuluri – had visited Malta two months earlier for meetings The concession agreement covering the running of St Luke’s Karin Grech and Gozo General Hospitals was awarded to VGH in 2015 The deal was later described as “collusion” between the government in the pretender phase The former VGH director also said that Muscat played a role in what Tumuluri claims was a forced handover of the concession to Steward for €1 Both Muscat and Schembri denied the claims Tumuluri also accused Steward Healthcare of engaging in unlawful activity with the government of Malta and insisted he only signed the concession over because he was made to fear for his life by government officials and others working on their behalf The 505page complaint includes an affidavit from Tumuluri and hundreds of pages of supporting documents such as internal emails contracts and project plans In his complaint to US authorities Tumuluri said the threats lasted through the period of the journalist’s assassination in October 2017 until he eventually caved into demands in December 2017 and signed the concession over because he feared his life and that of his family would be in danger if he didn’t According to Tumuluri’s disclosure Schembri warned him that “he is the law in Malta” and that no agreement could protect Tumuluri’s interest Schembri allegedly warned that “if the government could silence a vocal reporter like Ms Caruana Galizia Mr Tumuluri should be very careful not to make enemies with the government” Moreover Tumuluri alleged that during a meeting at Castille Schembri told him “You know what happened with Daphne Caruana Galizia and you don’t want to end up in that position You want us to be a friend not a foe” Tumuluri also disclosed several meetings in which he alleges his life had been threatened and claims he was pulled aside afterwards from one such meeting  by Mizzi who warned him “Don’t force these guys to go to that level”

Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Investigators are probing whether a potentially bogus consultancy contract was drawn up to justify the €60000 in consultancy payments Muscat received from SpringX Media and Accutor Consulting which used to be called VGH Europe Although Muscat denies any link between the payments and Vitals the company’s name was changed to Accutor Consulting AG in January 2018 just before Steward Healthcare took over the hospitals’ concession from VGH Muscat was paid a total of €60000 to his Bank of

should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “everything was carried out accordingly”

an income of almost €482000 from various consultancy work in the year he resigned as prime minister The earnings were covered by a flurry of consultancy contracts Muscat signed in the weeks and months after resigning Following an unprecedented political and institutional crisis Muscat announced his resignation in December 2019 but actually resigned in January 2020 Muscat baulked under the pressure

then energy minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s right hand man Keith Schembri According to The Times prime minister Robert Abela is wary of the inquiry’s outcome as he is concerned that highprofile arrests and possible prosecutions could throw the Labour Party into disarray Sources said police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police Moreover the investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella According to the reports Muscat claimed that he had been introduced to Bhatti “years back” by his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and that Bhatti got in touch with him “after I announced my resignation” “Strongly refuting” the allegations about the contract Muscat insisted that he has “carried out legitimate and documented work in connection with my contract” However when asked to provide any such documented evidence Muscat refused saying “It is evidence that shows the projects I have been working on and meetings held “I do not believe I should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “everything was carried out accordingly”
"Sudan war: Sudanese in Malta should be given protection, activist says","May 16, 2023 7:00 AM",Videos Miguela Xuereb Sudanese nationals in Malta should be granted some form of protection Hadia Bashir said as she urged the authorities to take action and offer these asylum seekers with some stability Bashir a former politician in Sudan sat down with Newsbookcommt to reflect on the situation in her country after intense clashes between Sudan’s military and country’s main paramilitary force erupted in midApril The clashes saw hundreds of people killed whilst thousands fled the country amid the power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime which has its roots before the 30year dictatorial rule of Omar Al Bashir was brought to an end in 2019 The Sudanese armed forces are broadly loyal to General Abdel Fattah alBurhan the country’s de facto ruler The paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces RSF are a collection of militia under the command of a former warlord General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemediti The RSF also known as Janjaweed was founded by Al Bashir to crush a rebellion in Darfur that began more than 20 years ago It was then transformed into a semiorganised paramilitary force by Al Bashir in 2013 with their leaders being deployed in South Sudan to crush a rebellion In 2019 RSF together with the Sudanese Armed Forces cooperated to oust Al Bashir However efforts to transition to a democratic civilianled government fell through following a coup in October 2021 Speaking to Newsbookcommt Bashir explained that the majority of the Sudanese in Malta are asylum seekers who are seeking for protection “It is now evident why they need protection” Bashir said as she insisted that by offering them some stability the Sudanese in Malta can feel safe and can also help their families back in Sudan “Applications for protection by Sudanese are usually rejected In our community we have a large number of Sudanese whose application has been rejected They are from Darfur and would have moved to Khartoum Now you can see how they are suffering” she said “They should be given some form of protection even temporary protection – it is better than nothing at all” Bashir underlined Describing Sudan as a rich country Bashir reminisced that the people were hopeful after the Al Bashir regime collapsed in 2019 following a 30year dictatorial rule “The hands of Al Bashir are still there” she said and noted that the democratic transition faltered Like diplomats in Khartoum who warned in early 2022 that violence would eventually break out the people of Sudan were expecting something to happen Asked if foreign nations could be involved in what was taking place Bashir said she could not accuse anyone adding that Sudanese suspect the involvement of third parties however it is not yet visible Whilst comparisons are odious the situation in Sudan was compared to the invasion of Ukraine with Bashir describing it “worse” since her conationals were being killed by Sudanese themselves “It is a real disaster Dead bodies on the roads looting and the hospitals are not functioning” she explained Moreover bordering countries are not safe “The countries are not 100 safe and people are waiting for help at the border” she said Bashir also added that there is hardly any media presence in the country documenting what is happening The Sudanese community in Malta is quite sizeable with the members having family back home The clashes brought with them internet outages making it difficult for Sudanese in Malta to reach out to their relatives back home A Sudanese in Malta had five of his family members killed during the clashes The former politician underlined that it was important that the general public in Malta to be aware of what is happening in Sudan “They need to know what is happening in our country and pray for the people in danger” Bashir said and added that Sudan also needed humanitarian assistance “There are organisations that moved in to assist the people in Turkey and Syria now the Sudanese need the same things we would be very grateful if they help out” she said Speaking about her political stint in Sudan Bashir said it was hard to be a woman and a politician representing the opposition party Among the five people elected she was the only woman representing women in the Red Sea state for five years “As a parliament member in an Opposition party you are not protected” Bashir recalled adding that one could easily be jailed because of a differing political opinion However she feels she delivered her message while in office Watch the full interview below
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”
‘The end result of living in a mafia state is death’ – Pia Zammit,"May 16, 2023 7:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “If you refuse to listen to the voices of the living then you will be forced to hear the screams of even more dead” activist Pia Zammit said in a speech at the 67th monthly vigil commemorating Daphne Caruana Galizia Echoing the phrase from antiMafia activists in Italy and elsewhere Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked harassed and vilified before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much” she said “If you truly want justice for her stories then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice To protect them from threats and physical harm What are you waiting for More deaths” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection In her speech Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country and a mafia state” adding that people fall in three camps those who endorse corruption those who turn a blind eye to corruption and those who actually see the full picture “However we’re all experiencing the full picture whether we like it or not” she said as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue  The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law” Zammit said “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women” Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime” He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree” Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice that they are not alone “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat ‘We will get there’ Sa Naslu is true It will happen if we don’t give up It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other” Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly or tells me that I will at least be here to see it the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner”
PN to hold national protest on Wednesday,"May 16, 2023 6:55 PM",The Nationalist Party will be holding national protest outside parliament on Wednesday following the damning NAO report on the hospitals privatisation deal Speaking in parliament on Tuesday evening PN leader Bernard Grech said the protest is being called as prime minister Robert Abela continues to undermine the country’s institutions The Opposition has held a series of protests after court annulled the deal which it said was fraudulent in February The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In recent days the PN has asked police chief Angelo Gafa to launch a criminal investigation on the individuals involved in the deal including Mizzi and Muscat however the police force has so far failed to react Moreover on Monday Abela chose to respond to the damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it by breaching parliamentary rules Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on the embarrassing report saw him bring it up in parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon with government rejecting a suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday Moreover on Tuesday the Labour Party held a press conference in which minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul insisted that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet
"Repubblika demands arrest of Muscat, Mizzi to prevent them from fleeing","May 16, 2023 3:07 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Repubblika asked the magistrate conducting an inquiry into the hospitals privatisation deal with Vitals Global Healthcare to take note of the damning Auditor General report on the concession and if necessary order the immediate arrest of people who are preparing to abscond In comments to Newsbookcommt Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said “we asked the inquiring magistrate to tale all the necessary action to prevent anyone involved in the ruse from fleeing the country” He added that court must order the arrest of anyone who could be preparing to abscond as he named former disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and former Labour ministers Konrad Mizzi and Chris Cardona The NGO also asked the magistrate to grant immunity to whoever was involved in the deal and is prepared to reveal their accomplices The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In a press conference outside the Valletta courthouse on Tuesday afternoon Aquilina underlined a number of findings in the NAO report including the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” between Muscat and Mizzi Among others Aquilina said the NAO report found that Muscat and Mizzi’s actions hindered health minister Chris Fearne’s ability to negotiate with Steward Healthcare SHC “The reluctance of the Minister for Tourism to step back from interactions with the SHC was detrimental to the Government’s interests for it created a weakness in its position all to evident to the SHC a weakness that – based on that noted by the Minister for Health – was readily exploited” the NAO said Aquilina also pointed out that Muscat and Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers over the agreement that saw government act as guarantor of Steward Healthcare’s loan from Bank of Valletta While noting the “complicity” between former prime minister Joseph Muscat and Mizzi to mislead the Cabinet of ministers Repubblika asked the inquiring magistrate to order the Attorney General to issue an exemption from prosecution under the Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act for persons involved in the deal who are willing to reveal their accomplices Aquilina explained that former VGH director Ram Tumuluri had wanted to spill the beans on the secret deal adding that the report concluded that Tumuluri had been pressured in to transferring his shares to Steward The application filed this morning by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asked the magistrate to prevent further destruction of the evidence and prevent the suspects from leaving the island with Aquilina saying that Repubblika was informed that preparations to abscond were already underway Describing the concession as an “obscene ruse” Aquilina said the NAO report also highlights the involvement of Muscat’s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi’s then permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi The NAO report Aquilina added states that Muscat and Mizzi’s ploy to mislead the Cabinet of ministers would not have been possible without Ronald Mizzi’s involvement In 2019 Repubblika had filed an application demanding a criminal probe into the VGH deal after the Criminal Court had quashed an order to hold a magisterial inquiry placing disgraced former ministers Konrad Mizzi Edward Scicluna and Chris Cardona under magisterial scrutiny Cardona had signed a memorandum of understanding with VGH in October 2014 months before a request for proposals was even issued for the concession to operate three of Malta’s state hospitals Repubblika had demanded a criminal probe to establish if there was criminal complicity by three ministers in the controversial contract which was then annulled by court in February 2023 In their application the activists had accused the three ministers of facilitating a “coordinated” “act of modernday piracy” “corruption and money laundering among other crimes” which saw VGH’s investor leave a debt of €50 million
Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul said Predictably he went on to suggest that the government would resist this and do the opposite
IM chief dismisses concerns about safety of crash barriers,"May 16, 2023 1:25 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Road crash barriers deployed by Infrastructure Malta conform and are certified in line with European standards the agency’s CEO Ivan Falzon said In comments to Newsbookcommt Falzon dismissed concerns raised by motorcyclists over the safety of road barriers in Maltese roads Following the tragic death of Rupert Tabone on Sunday afternoon many motorcyclists blamed the poorly designed crash barriers for the the latest road fatality Tabone 54 died on Sunday afternoon after he lost control of his motorcycle on Triq Dun Karm in Birkirkara The man was pronounced dead on site Footage from the incident site show that the victim was caught between the crash barriers dividing the two carriageways with eyewitnesses explaining that he was stuck beneath them Taking to social media several motorcyclists insisted that such crash barriers are a death trap and responsible for many deaths In the past motorcyclists warned that the crash barrier ends can be “like crashing into the sharp edge of a knife” However Falzon said that crash barriers on Maltese roads are fully certified according to EU regulations and are installed in accordance with the producer’s installation method “Over the last few years since its inception Infrastructure Malta IM introduced new standards for road infrastructure including new restraint systems and such approaches have been implemented across the various projects IM implemented” Falzon said He added that “when it comes to road safety I see a collective responsibility of all starting from our individual behaviour when driving to our ambitious but achievable target in designing more forgiving roads including applying new technologies and standards as they become available” Recently ĦażŻebbuġ councillor Steve Zammit Lupi a motorcyclist himself likened the crash barriers on Maltese roads to a grater and said they cause serious injuries to the victim A 2015 study by the Swedish Motorcyclists Association had found that guardrails with unprotected posts and protruding parts lead to the most serious injuries Smooth barriers without unprotected posts provide less risk of injury According to the Federation of European Motorcyclists Association space underneath the crash barrier beam can also be dangerous Riders sliding on the ground can go underneath the guardrail or hit a post and both can lead to severe injury

Appeals court convicts men who illegally detained journalists at Castille in 2019,"May 16, 2023 10:09 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected After that press conference at around 3am on 29 November three men who refused to identify themselves but who appeared to act as plainclothes security guards kept the journalists from leaving the building The trio were subsequently identified as Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay and charged with illegally detaining four journalists – Agius Xuereb Paul Caruana Galizia and Julian Bonnici While more journalists were present – as footage of the incident showed – their version of events was never sought The case did not appear to have been treated with any urgency by the police a police report was filed on 2 December 2019 by Agius and Xuereb with the former presenting footage she filmed on her phone as evidence and charges were issued on 14 July Despite this delay Magistrate Joe Mifsud had found the police investigation to be lacking and in his acquittal of the three men he argued that his hands were tied by the charge – and evidence – presented by the prosecution In his view the evidence was not sufficient to prove the charge to the level required by the court But the Office of the Attorney General ended up filing an appeal in which it insisted that Magistrate Mifsud drew his conclusion on the basis of an erroneous application of the law Lawyer Etienne Savona had highlighted that the defendants were clearly impeding access to the door journalists had used to enter Castille and that such behaviour gave the journalists the impression that a physical confrontation would emerge if they persisted in their attempts to leave the building Ultimately Judge Aaron Bugeja upheld the AG’s appeal overturning the acquittal and finding the three men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest The judge opted to conditionally discharge the trio for 6 months giving them the standard warning that committing another offence in this period would also see them punished for the illegal arrest they carried out at the Office of the Prime Minister
Standards commissioner asked to investigate officials who ignored NAO queries,"May 16, 2023 9:19 AM",Standards Commissioner Joe Azzopardi has been asked to investigate two public appointees – Malta Enterprise CEO Kurt Farrugia and State Aid Monitoring Board chair Paul Zahra – for their failure to comply with the National Audit Office’s requests for information concerning the hospitals concession managed by Vitals and Steward The NAO’s third report was published on Monday and its damning findings include the conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi had misled Cabinet when the concession was transferred from Vitals to Steward and that he had engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter But in his letter to the Office of the Standards Commissioner the independent political candidate Arnold Cassola – whose letters have initiated the lion’s share of the investigations tackled by the office to date – focused on a brief remark in the 450page report “Of concern to the NAO was that Malta Enterprise failed to reply to any of the queries submitted This Office sought information relating to the lease agreement entered into by Government with the QMUL for the Barts Medical School and an account of the payments received by Malta Enterprise in this respect Similarly queries submitted to the SAMB remained unaddressed” Auditor General Charles Deguara said This behaviour was deemed unacceptable by Cassola who accused Farrugia and Zahra of “attempting to sabotage the NAO’s inquiry into the misappropriation of over €400 million in public funds from Vitals and Steward at the expense of the Maltese public and in the complicity of a number of politicians including former minister Konrad Mizzi He described their behaviour as ‘omertà’ insisting that this was not acceptable “in a state that adheres to the democratic values of transparency and truth” Farrugia had been an integral part of former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s secretariat before being appointed as Malta Enterprise CEO in 2019 acting as head of government communication and Muscat’s spokesperson Earlier this year Cassola had asked the SAMB to investigate the concession following last February landmark judgment which cancelled it and deemed it “fraudulent” receiving no reply

Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “criminal association to launder money originating from corruption” Aquilina described it as a “textbook case of money laundering” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country” “From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “remained silent and has not denied anything”
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"Sudan war: Sudanese in Malta should be given protection, activist says","May 16, 2023 7:00 AM",Videos Miguela Xuereb Sudanese nationals in Malta should be granted some form of protection Hadia Bashir said as she urged the authorities to take action and offer these asylum seekers with some stability Bashir a former politician in Sudan sat down with Newsbookcommt to reflect on the situation in her country after intense clashes between Sudan’s military and country’s main paramilitary force erupted in midApril The clashes saw hundreds of people killed whilst thousands fled the country amid the power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime which has its roots before the 30year dictatorial rule of Omar Al Bashir was brought to an end in 2019 The Sudanese armed forces are broadly loyal to General Abdel Fattah alBurhan the country’s de facto ruler The paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces RSF are a collection of militia under the command of a former warlord General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemediti The RSF also known as Janjaweed was founded by Al Bashir to crush a rebellion in Darfur that began more than 20 years ago It was then transformed into a semiorganised paramilitary force by Al Bashir in 2013 with their leaders being deployed in South Sudan to crush a rebellion In 2019 RSF together with the Sudanese Armed Forces cooperated to oust Al Bashir However efforts to transition to a democratic civilianled government fell through following a coup in October 2021 Speaking to Newsbookcommt Bashir explained that the majority of the Sudanese in Malta are asylum seekers who are seeking for protection “It is now evident why they need protection” Bashir said as she insisted that by offering them some stability the Sudanese in Malta can feel safe and can also help their families back in Sudan “Applications for protection by Sudanese are usually rejected In our community we have a large number of Sudanese whose application has been rejected They are from Darfur and would have moved to Khartoum Now you can see how they are suffering” she said “They should be given some form of protection even temporary protection – it is better than nothing at all” Bashir underlined Describing Sudan as a rich country Bashir reminisced that the people were hopeful after the Al Bashir regime collapsed in 2019 following a 30year dictatorial rule “The hands of Al Bashir are still there” she said and noted that the democratic transition faltered Like diplomats in Khartoum who warned in early 2022 that violence would eventually break out the people of Sudan were expecting something to happen Asked if foreign nations could be involved in what was taking place Bashir said she could not accuse anyone adding that Sudanese suspect the involvement of third parties however it is not yet visible Whilst comparisons are odious the situation in Sudan was compared to the invasion of Ukraine with Bashir describing it “worse” since her conationals were being killed by Sudanese themselves “It is a real disaster Dead bodies on the roads looting and the hospitals are not functioning” she explained Moreover bordering countries are not safe “The countries are not 100 safe and people are waiting for help at the border” she said Bashir also added that there is hardly any media presence in the country documenting what is happening The Sudanese community in Malta is quite sizeable with the members having family back home The clashes brought with them internet outages making it difficult for Sudanese in Malta to reach out to their relatives back home A Sudanese in Malta had five of his family members killed during the clashes The former politician underlined that it was important that the general public in Malta to be aware of what is happening in Sudan “They need to know what is happening in our country and pray for the people in danger” Bashir said and added that Sudan also needed humanitarian assistance “There are organisations that moved in to assist the people in Turkey and Syria now the Sudanese need the same things we would be very grateful if they help out” she said Speaking about her political stint in Sudan Bashir said it was hard to be a woman and a politician representing the opposition party Among the five people elected she was the only woman representing women in the Red Sea state for five years “As a parliament member in an Opposition party you are not protected” Bashir recalled adding that one could easily be jailed because of a differing political opinion However she feels she delivered her message while in office Watch the full interview below
Mandatory union membership is anti-democratic – Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara,"May 15, 2023 8:53 PM",Mandatory trade union membership is a violation of human dignity and democracy Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara Young Christian Workers’ Movement said on Monday In a statement ŻĦN said that while “unionisation is an empowering and liberating act affirming the dignity of all work and workers” it opposed mandatory membership “First of all ŻĦN regards this as an infringement of the basic democratic right of freedom of association concurring with the Maltese Constitutional Court and European Court of Human Rights” Secondly ŻĦN said it is suspicious of the effectiveness of the proposal which was included in the Labour party’s electoral programme ahead of last year’s victory at the polls “It has been claimed that this “would boost the fight against precarious employment and exploitation” How would obligatory membership in unions that have not uttered but a whisper on the death of Jean Paul Sofia or hundreds of other workers who have lost life or limb on construction sites protect workers from precarity” ŻĦN said ŻĦN also took aim at the leaders of Malta’s biggest unions – the General Workers Union GWU and UĦM – with the movement saying that “we have a situation where the leaders of the two main unions are on the government payroll eroding the faith of honest workers in the impartiality of union structures To propose mandatory membership as a remedy is autocratic and absurd” “It is a mature evaluation of the structure and operation of unions in Malta that is required as well as a hardnosed analysis of the slow erosion of workers’ rights and conditions that is creeping in” ŻĦN added The proposal has also been heavily criticised by business lobbies with the Malta Employers’ Association MEA the Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry and the Malta Chamber of SMEs have urging the Labour administration to withdraw its proposal Last year the business lobbies said that the measure as proposed is “regressive and undemocratic” and will not in any way strengthen the state of industrial relations and social dialogue in Malta Before the March 2022 election prime minister Robert Abela said that although he believed vulnerable workers should be protected he was open to discuss mandatory union membership with business leaders However both main unions support the proposal with GWU general secretary Josef Bugeja urging Abela to introduce mandatory membership in the run up to this year’s May Day Bugeja said this could help fight precarious employment Likewise UĦM boss Josef Vella said that the union has long called for mandatory union membership for low income workers who are often exploited by employers
Konrad Mizzi dismisses NAO report as ‘blatantly false’,"May 15, 2023 8:09 PM",Former Labour minister Konrad Mizzi dismissed the damning National Audit Report which concluded that he had misled the Cabinet of ministers over the hospitals concession deal as “pure conjecture irresponsible and blatantly false” Mizzi’s tirade against the NAO comes despite his refusal to cooperate with the investigation with the report saying that the former minister’s failure to cooperate was “inexcusable” The report concluded that Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” However in a Facebook post on Monday Mizzi denied this and insisted that Cabinet held lengthy discussion at various stages of the concession deal “Some context is necessary On the 26th August 2019 I had briefed Cabinet that terms for credit facilities from BOV were discussed and that BOV was seeking additional safeguards The memorandum to Cabinet clearly stated that in the event of a court declaration of nullity of the concession government would become liable to pay the lender’s debt and would trigger a government event of default” Mizzi claimed He added that this was deemed necessary following discussions with the Ministry of Finance Bank of Valletta and other stakeholders “Lengthy discussions took place in Cabinet on the implications of both lender’s debt and a government’s event of default and I answered all questions raised by my peers as the then Prime Minister who chaired the meeting himself confirms” he said in reference to Joseph Muscat Muscat himself had attempted to shift blame of the deal which court said is fraudulent on to his ministers Reacting to the court judgment in February Muscat claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and decisions by the Cabinet However former minister Evarist Bartolo refuted Muscat’s claims and said ”Following comments about the cabinet in reaction to the court’s ruling on the hospital’s deal with foreign companies is it fair to use the cabinet as a smokescreen” Bartolo also told Times of Malta that the hospital deal details were not discussed in Cabinet and “the devil is in the details” Moreover the court judgment which annulled the concessions pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back
PM flouts parliament rules to react to hospitals report before anyone can read it,"May 15, 2023 6:46 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela was so keen to respond to the National Audit Office’s damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it properly that he chose to openly flout parliamentary procedure to do so Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on a report that appears to be an embarrassment to his government saw him bring it up in Parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon the government rejected its suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In the absence of an agreement Parliament continued with its scheduled debate on the financial estimates of the Environment and Resources Authority while the Nationalist Party scheduled an urgent press conference for 530pm at Parliament House But just as the PN’s press conference was about to begin – in timing that could hardly be considered coincidental – Abela chose to participate in the ERA debate to react to the report In doing so he was clearly out of order and in breach of parliamentary procedure as repeatedly highlighted by PN leader Bernard Grech and other MPs in points of order that they raised But while speaker Anġlu Farrugia accepted that Abela was in breach of procedure Malta’s longestserving speaker proved unable or unwilling to intervene His repeated appeals to Abela fell on deaf ears and Farrugia opted against taking further action While no journalist had been given the opportunity to read the 450page report properly before Abela launched his speech – the report was only made public around an hour earlier – the initial reports by Maltese newsrooms seized on the AuditorGeneral’s conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over a deal with Steward Health Care which obliged the government to pay the company €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled But Abela – who was legal adviser to his predecessor Joseph Muscat when this controversial agreement was reached – made no reference to this or any reference to Mizzi or Muscat at all Instead he focused on a limited defence on what took place when he became PM in 2020 and insisted that he was actually pleased with the findings of the report because for all the problems identified with the concession the report did not identify any misconduct on the part of his own government Consequently he argued he and his government were “serene” even if his insistence on reacting to a report before anyone could actually read it suggested an entirely different scenario Abela also referred to Grech’s decision last week to call on police commissioner Angelo Gafà to investigate him in connection with the hospitals deal insisting that the NAO report made clear that this gambit made no sense as it lacked any credibility As he did so he also drew comparison with a previous criminal complaint targeting his government that made by Repubblika in the wake of the death of a group of asylum seekers in Malta’s searchandrescue area and reports alleging the intentional sabotage of a rubber boat As he had then Abela complained that the PN – he had made no distinction between the party and the activist group three years ago and did not do so on Monday – wanted to send him to prison But in doing so the selfdescribed progressive political leader also reiterated antimigrant rhetoric that would generally be considered to be the preserve of farright politicians describing Malta’s actions in 2020 as a reaction to “increased infections” caused by asylum seekers There is no suggestion that asylum seekers – which are in any case detained at length on arrival through Malta’s controversial detention policy described as “arbitrary” by the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner  – had contributed to the spread of Covid19 or other infections at the time In fact Abela’s government at the time had even taken the unorthodox – and highly questionable from a human rights perspective – step of housing asylum seekers for weeks on end on pleasure boats that were patently unfit for this purpose Abela’s speech predictably derailed the discussion with the next PN MPs to speak taking his cue to disregard the agenda of the day to react to his comments Grech and former PN leader Adrian Delia both described Abela’s actions as an attempt to control the narrative on a scandal before anyone could reasonably read the report The PN leader dismissed the impression Abela sought to portray describing the NAO report as “yet another confirmation that the Labour governments of Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela are accomplices to the greatest fraud this country has ever witnessed” He insisted that Abela’s decision to speak at the same time the PN’s press conference was taken place was a new “abyss” for Abela which testified to the fact that he is “confused weak and compromised” words he has used to describe Abela in recent weeks Grech was also adamant that the air of serenity Abela was seeking to project was a façade and that the PM was clearly preoccupied by the latest developments “He promised continuity” Grech said in reference to remarks Abela nade when he succeeded Muscat as Labour leader and PM “And today we have yet another confirmation that he has delivered it”
Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration
Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over hospitals concession deal – NAO,"May 15, 2023 5:41 PM",Former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval a damning NAO audit shows The new audit report states that Mizzi acted in “haste” and the transfer was authorised “unilaterally” without “the appropriate sanction” by the Cabinet of ministers The requests by VGH were only discussed in Cabinet on 9 January 2018 “days after the approvals” by the then tourism minister had already been granted the report says After racking up €36 million in debts VGH then agreed to transfer the contract to Steward Healthcare for a reported €1 The report also belies disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s claims that all decisions taken on the hospitals deal were taken by his Cabinet of ministers Speaking in the aftermath of the court judgment that annulled the concession agreement in February Muscat had claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and collective decisions by the Cabinet Mizzi is also accused of having misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” “The delegation of responsibility for a health concession to the Minister for Tourism was deemed illogical by the NAO and provided a convenient opportunity for the exploitation of Government creating weakness where there ought to have been none a weakness all to readily leveraged by the SHC” “The most evident exploitation was that secured by the SHC in terms of Government’s liability to pay €100000000 and the sum of the lenders’ debt to the Concessionaire in case of courtdeclared nullity of the concession agreements irrespective of the party attributed the default a situation precipitated by the Minister for Tourism and engineered through his misleading of Cabinet Compounding matters was that Cabinet’s authorisation was not sought by the Minister for Tourism in instances when Government acted as guarantor in several financing agreements entered into by the SHC and the BOV” In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months This came after former PN leader Adrian Delia opened a court case in 2018 in a bid to force the cancellation of the 99year emphyteutical concession agreement on the basis that the original concessionaire VGH and their heirs in title Steward Healthcare had not fulfilled their contractual obligations Depasquale had harsh words for all parties involved in the deal including government concessionaires VGH and Steward Healthcare and in a scathing sentence said government had failed to protect the national interest in the privatisation deal In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement” Defying all logic the judge said Mizzi granted VGH another three years automatically extendable for another year and a half that is four and a half years in total ie until the end of the year 2022 to do what they had failed to do by September 2018 The judge also pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back The latest report was tabled in parliament on Monday afternoon Government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament holds an urgent debate on the report published by the NAO But the Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO’s findings Moreover the National Audit Office expressed great concern that Mizzi refused to collaborate during the probe “It is with the gravest concern that the NAO views the failure of the Minister for Tourism to cooperate in this audit as inexcusable compounded no less by the centrality of his role in the concession The shirking of accountability on the part of the Minister for Tourism hampered this Office in its understanding of the initial developments that led to the concession being taken over by the SHC and impacted other aspects for which he assumed responsibility in relation thereto most notably in authorising the change of control and in representing Government as guarantor for funds secured by the SHC” In addition the NAO said it could not verify assertions made by others regarding the role played by Mizzi in this concession “The NAO holds a bleak view of the Minister for Tourism’s conduct in this respect for ministers of Government and public officials who have acted in the interests of the Government should find no difficulty in accounting for their decisions and actions The action on the part of the Minister for Tourism in not cooperating with the NAO was deemed deplorable”

Muscat vows to fight on ‘even if I am alone’,"May 17, 2023 11:36 AM",Former prime minister Jospeh Muscat said he is ready to fight allegations that he received payments from a company closely linked to the company awarded the controversial hospitals concession under his tenure “even if I am alone in doing so” In what can be deemed a veiled message to his successor Robert Abela a combative Muscat claimed the revelations from a corruption probe were “a frame up” Moreover in comments to MaltaToday on Wednesday morning Muscat  said “I do not fear arrest” In a Facebook post Muscat said “the concerted attack by the usual suspects has resumed if it ever ceased” adding that “as I am no longer in politics I will chose where and how I reply” “I have already gone through all this when they came up with the Egrant lie I will make sure that those who are manipulating facts are pursued through justice when time comes and that truth prevails even if I am alone in doing this” he wrote Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe linked to the hospitals’ deal according to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Among others investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” In his statement Muscat claimed “I always got paid for work I have carried out I gave evidence of this to the Magistrate and I asked her various times to be able to testify She has never replied to my requests” He added that the revelations published on Wednesday “are obvious leaks from the work being done by the Magistrate” He went on to repeat allegations he previously made that the magistrate leaked information on the probe to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina insisting that this undermined trust in the investigations “The same had happened when there were people who were informed beforehand on what was going to happen boasted publicly about that and even came on my doorstep to observe first hand This betrays any form of trust There are also other points which I will make in the right fora with the due respect for the institutions” Muscat also took a parting shot at his adversaries by claiming that “contrary to others I declare my income and pay my taxes” However he did not mention any names

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

PN to hold national protest on Wednesday,"May 16, 2023 6:55 PM",The Nationalist Party will be holding national protest outside parliament on Wednesday following the damning NAO report on the hospitals privatisation deal Speaking in parliament on Tuesday evening PN leader Bernard Grech said the protest is being called as prime minister Robert Abela continues to undermine the country’s institutions The Opposition has held a series of protests after court annulled the deal which it said was fraudulent in February The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In recent days the PN has asked police chief Angelo Gafa to launch a criminal investigation on the individuals involved in the deal including Mizzi and Muscat however the police force has so far failed to react Moreover on Monday Abela chose to respond to the damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it by breaching parliamentary rules Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on the embarrassing report saw him bring it up in parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon with government rejecting a suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday Moreover on Tuesday the Labour Party held a press conference in which minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul insisted that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe linked to the hospitals’ deal according to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Investigators are probing whether a potentially bogus consultancy contract was drawn up to justify the €60000 in consultancy payments Muscat received from SpringX Media and Accutor Consulting which used to be called VGH Europe Although Muscat denies any link between the payments and Vitals the company’s name was changed to Accutor Consulting AG in January 2018 just before Steward Healthcare took over the hospitals’ concession from VGH Muscat was paid a total of €60000 to his Bank of Valletta account in 2020 the first payment taking place just two months after he stepped down in January of that year The former prime minister received four monthly payments two from Accutor AG and two from Spring X Media another Swiss firm run by the same owner – Pakistani businessman Wasay Bhatti Spring X Media is registered at the same Swiss address as Accutor AG and the two companies carried out transactions between each other The Accutor AG payments to Muscat were made under the terms of an indefinite consultancy contract drawn up between himself and Spring X Media in February 2020 just one month after he resigned Despite the indefinite nature of the consultancy contract signed when Muscat was still an MP the payments ended abruptly in the summer of 2020 The contract was to earn Muscat €15000 a month for three years for a total of €540000 It was also to be automatically renewed for another three years before it was suddenly stopped after four monthly payments when Accutor went out of business Muscat’s residence was searched by police in January 2022 as a result of an inquiry anticorruption NGO Repubblika requested in 2018 But Muscat denied that the search had anything to do with his Accutor contract or suspicions that it was bogus and merely a vehicle to receive kickbacks from the hospitals’ deal Likewise the reports say that former minister Konrad Mizzi’s home has also been searched as part of the probe and had his smartphone confiscated by police Transactions of Accutor AG the Swiss payroll company that played a key role in funnelling funds from VGHSteward and Bluestone show that the companies sent at least €7 million to Accutor which then directed payments toward VGH directors and behindthescenes investors According to his 2020 tax return Muscat declared an income of almost €482000 from various consultancy work in the year he resigned as prime minister The earnings were covered by a flurry of consultancy contracts Muscat signed in the weeks and months after resigning Following an unprecedented political and institutional crisis Muscat announced his resignation in December 2019 but actually resigned in January 2020 Muscat baulked under the pressure of weeks of protests following the the emergence of alleged links between government officials and the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and the arrest of Yorgen Fenech Fenech is awaiting a trial after being accused of masterminding the murder Moreover his Dubairegistered company 17 Black allegedly intended to funnel money to two Panama companies belonging to then energy minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s right hand man Keith Schembri According to The Times prime minister Robert Abela is wary of the inquiry’s outcome as he is concerned that highprofile arrests and possible prosecutions could throw the Labour Party into disarray Sources said police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police Moreover the investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella According to the reports Muscat claimed that he had been introduced to Bhatti “years back” by his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and that Bhatti got in touch with him “after I announced my resignation” “Strongly refuting” the allegations about the contract Muscat insisted that he has “carried out legitimate and documented work in connection with my contract” However when asked to provide any such documented evidence Muscat refused saying “It is evidence that shows the projects I have been working on and meetings held “I do not believe I should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “everything was carried out accordingly”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Judge selection: Constitutional Court rejects Fenech’s appeal; slams court administration for wrong practice,"May 12, 2023 6:38 PM",The Constitutional Court has rejected a claim by murder suspect Yorgen Fenech who filed a case alleging that his right to a fair hearing had been breached when a judge was selected to preside over his trial by jury Fenech is awaiting trial by jury for his alleged role in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia The former Electrogas director has been indicted for complicity and criminal conspiracy and is expected to go on trial in the coming months Fenech’s lawyers had argued that their client’s right to a fair trial had been breached because Madam Justice Edwina Grima had been nominated to preside over his eventual trial by jury This came after Mr Justice Aaron Bugeja withdrew from the trial Grima’s nomination had been vetted by the Attorney General who had issued the bill of indictment against Fenech The Constitutional Court presided over by judges Giannino Caruana Demajo Tonio Mallia and Anthony Ellul ruled that the selection of the trial judge had been made according to law since Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti had taken the decision It further observed that the Attorney General had no say in the selection process During the proceedings it emerged that the Chief Justice’s recommendation had been sent by the deputy registrar for the criminal courts to the Attorney General with a note saying “The Chief Justice’s recommendation is being referred for your kind legal vetting and onwards transmission to the Minister for Justice and Governance” The AG then forwarded the document to the justice minister with another note which said “Recommendation by the Chief Justice is hereby being referred Subject to your approval you may wish to advise HE the President accordingly” The minister sent the document to the President with a note saying “Your Excellency is respectfully advised to approve duties as detailed at Red 1” the next day The president approved the nomination two days later Before the First Hall of the Civil Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction the court ruled that there had been an absence of evidence to support the serious claims being made and ruled that the request was “solely the umpteenth attempt to uselessly prolong proceedings” The appeal was subsequently rejected however the Constitutional Court criticized the court administration for never having questioned the practice which gave rise to the case It observed that the law does not give any role or power to the Attorney General nor to the justice minister when the Chief Justice makes a recommendation about subrogation The Constitutional Court underlined that the wrong practice was a a result of the mentality which is prevalent in the court administration that things are done in a way because they have always been so It was also highlighted that the AG should have sent back the documents informing the court registry that at law she had no power to intervene on the matter Instead of informing the court registry however the Constitutional Court observed that the AG went along with the practice without verifying its legal basis The Constitutional Court underlined that the first court was wrong when it held that the AG’s signature was necessary for the nomination process to proceed The court registrar was also wrong when he said that all signatures are needed before the document is delivered to the President of Malta It was underlined that the Chief Justice’s signature alone sufficed for the subrogation to go to the President of Malta It was also noted that the decision had been made by the Chief Justice before the wrong practice was introduced The Constitutional Court also observed that despite the choice was called a “recommendation” it was a binding on the president who has no choice but to approve The Constitutional Court held that the legal vetting that could have been done by the Attorney General was just an “empty exercise useless and irrelevant because she could not change anything and it did not change anything It only served to create this useless episode because the Attorney General relied on practice without first seeing what the law says” The Constitutional Court ordered Fenech to foot threequarters of the court expenses while the AG and the state advocate were ordered to foot the remaining quarter of the bill

Maltese language sidelined at EU level as government opting for English,"May 12, 2023 1:27 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Although the Maltese language is one of the EU’s official languages it is increasingly being sidelined and most business relating to Malta is being conducted in English Newsbookcommt is informed that several Maltese nationals employed by EU institutions did not have their contract renewed and were replaced by citizens from other member states These positions were occupied by Maltese nationals who were responsible to write and translate  documents and correspondence in Maltese Persons who work within EU institutions told Newsbook that this situation is only getting worse because Maltese ministries and authorities are increasingly opting to correspond with the European institutions in English This they said is sidelining the Maltese language and making many people employed within EU institutions redundant A case in point is the hearing of cases against Malta at the European Court of Justice where the cases are being heard in English although Malta has every right to demand that proceedings are held in Maltese One such court case is the European Commission’s case against Malta over the trapping season The European Court of Justice’s webpage shows that proceedings are being held in English Sources who spoke to this newsroom explained that this situation arose from the Maltese government’s decision to correspond in English Moreover several Maltese MEPs have repeatedly been complaining about a lack of Maltese interpreters and translators Recently Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba said that it is not acceptable that he cannot speak Maltese while addressing a European Parliament committee Questions sent by Newsbook to the foreign and European affairs ministry on the situation remain unanswered Peter Agius a PN candidate for European elections and senior official of the European Parliament today wrote an open letter to the 21 Permanent Secretaries of the Government with a call for them to change ongoing practices of not communicating in Maltese with the European institutions “Maltese is an official language of the European Union but if we do not use it it will lose its importance in the institutions” Agius warned Agius who previously headed the European Parliament Office in Malta explained how the European Commission is obliged by law to communicate with national administrations in all the official languages including Maltese when government departments write in Maltese “However this is not being done as government offices are invariably wavering the right to use Maltese and are systematically writing in the English language instead” he said Calling for this “malpractice to stop immediately” Agius aid this “is not only tarnishing the status and dignity of the Maltese language as an official language but is also leading to various services of the European Commission choosing not to employ Maltese personnel simply because the Malta desk can get by in English” ‘We have reached the ridiculous situation that the court cases brought by the European Commission in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg are being led in English and not Maltese Among them is the latest trapping case which is bound to be heard and written in English There is no other country in Europe that gives up its language rights in this way “I cannot even imagine the French or Poles using a language other than their national language in these fora The European Commission can now be exempt from using Maltese as it is the Maltese Government itself that is choosing to use only the English language in its formal communication The irony of this is that the Maltese Courts in Malta generally use the Maltese language So we know how to work Maltese legal language in Malta but can’t do that overseas”

PM flouts parliament rules to react to hospitals report before anyone can read it,"May 15, 2023 6:46 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela was so keen to respond to the National Audit Office’s damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it properly that he chose to openly flout parliamentary procedure to do so Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on a report that appears to be an embarrassment to his government saw him bring it up in Parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon the government rejected its suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In the absence of an agreement Parliament continued with its scheduled debate on the financial estimates of the Environment and Resources Authority while the Nationalist Party scheduled an urgent press conference for 530pm at Parliament House But just as the PN’s press conference was about to begin – in timing that could hardly be considered coincidental – Abela chose to participate in the ERA debate to react to the report In doing so he was clearly out of order and in breach of parliamentary procedure as repeatedly highlighted by PN leader Bernard Grech and other MPs in points of order that they raised But while speaker Anġlu Farrugia accepted that Abela was in breach of procedure Malta’s longestserving speaker proved unable or unwilling to intervene His repeated appeals to Abela fell on deaf ears and Farrugia opted against taking further action While no journalist had been given the opportunity to read the 450page report properly before Abela launched his speech – the report was only made public around an hour earlier – the initial reports by Maltese newsrooms seized on the AuditorGeneral’s conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over a deal with Steward Health Care which obliged the government to pay the company €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled But Abela – who was legal adviser to his predecessor Joseph Muscat when this controversial agreement was reached – made no reference to this or any reference to Mizzi or Muscat at all Instead he focused on a limited defence on what took place when he became PM in 2020 and insisted that he was actually pleased with the findings of the report because for all the problems identified with the concession the report did not identify any misconduct on the part of his own government Consequently he argued he and his government were “serene” even if his insistence on reacting to a report before anyone could actually read it suggested an entirely different scenario Abela also referred to Grech’s decision last week to call on police commissioner Angelo Gafà to investigate him in connection with the hospitals deal insisting that the NAO report made clear that this gambit made no sense as it lacked any credibility As he did so he also drew comparison with a previous criminal complaint targeting his government that made by Repubblika in the wake of the death of a group of asylum seekers in Malta’s searchandrescue area and reports alleging the intentional sabotage of a rubber boat As he had then Abela complained that the PN – he had made no distinction between the party and the activist group three years ago and did not do so on Monday – wanted to send him to prison But in doing so the selfdescribed progressive political leader also reiterated antimigrant rhetoric that would generally be considered to be the preserve of farright politicians describing Malta’s actions in 2020 as a reaction to “increased infections” caused by asylum seekers There is no suggestion that asylum seekers – which are in any case detained at length on arrival through Malta’s controversial detention policy described as “arbitrary” by the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner  – had contributed to the spread of Covid19 or other infections at the time In fact Abela’s government at the time had even taken the unorthodox – and highly questionable from a human rights perspective – step of housing asylum seekers for weeks on end on pleasure boats that were patently unfit for this purpose Abela’s speech predictably derailed the discussion with the next PN MPs to speak taking his cue to disregard the agenda of the day to react to his comments Grech and former PN leader Adrian Delia both described Abela’s actions as an attempt to control the narrative on a scandal before anyone could reasonably read the report The PN leader dismissed the impression Abela sought to portray describing the NAO report as “yet another confirmation that the Labour governments of Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela are accomplices to the greatest fraud this country has ever witnessed” He insisted that Abela’s decision to speak at the same time the PN’s press conference was taken place was a new “abyss” for Abela which testified to the fact that he is “confused weak and compromised” words he has used to describe Abela in recent weeks Grech was also adamant that the air of serenity Abela was seeking to project was a façade and that the PM was clearly preoccupied by the latest developments “He promised continuity” Grech said in reference to remarks Abela nade when he succeeded Muscat as Labour leader and PM “And today we have yet another confirmation that he has delivered it”
Occupy Justice demands reopening of Egrant inquiry,"May 17, 2023 9:39 AM",Activists from Occupy Justice staged a protest outside Castille on Tuesday evening calling for the Egrant inquiry to be reopened “The reopening of the Egrant Inquiry is long overdue You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves for ignoring this History will not be kind to you for betraying those you were duty bound to serve and protect  Take action or resign” the activists warned Robert Abela’s administration In September 2021 Magistrate Ian Farrugia called for the reopening of Egrant inquiry  However to date the Attorney General has failed to take any action In spite of recent revelations regarding the Egrant Inquiry and all the dirty manoeuvres by Pilatus Bank officials and employees Occupy Justice said “there hasn’t been so much as a peep of action from the Floriana Police Depot or the Attorney General’s office” The magisterial inquiry into Pilatus Bank ordered that the Egrant inquiry be reopened after finding reasonable suspicion that 11 million were transferred from Azerbaijan to an account at Pilatus Bank through a parallel and secretive accounting system Murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had claimed that Egrant was owned by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s wife Michelle and the company received a payment of US1017 from Leyla Aliyeva daughter of Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev The Muscats vehemently deny these allegations An inquiry ordered by Muscat had found no evidence linking him and his wife to the secret Panama company but the owner remains unknown to this day “Whilst they’re dragging their feet and coming up with excuses to justify their inaction making sure that justice is delayed criminals roam free and are gifted years of a headstart to cover their tracks It seems that our institutions are spinelessly hell bent in protecting fraudsters and corrupt individuals instead of investigating them” Occupy Justice said Reminding finance minister Clyde Caruana that on 1 November 2019 he pledged to make available all necessary resources should there be ‘a request’ to reopen the Egrant Inquiry Occupy Justice said “that request was made by Magistrate Ian Farrugia who called for it to be reopened The Attorney General was legally obliged to comply with Magistrate Farrugia’s order Instead this was ignored – not that we’ve come to expect better from this office” “Well here we are making the request again We’re also demanding that this time round the terms for the Inquiry are not drafted by the prime suspect in the case It is laughable that this happened in the first place” They added that the contempt with which the Labour administration has treated the Maltese people for these past ten years is unprecedented “using its privilege and power to shield those who should have faced justice years ago All this makes us wonder as to who is really pulling the strings”
Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Repubblika returns donation it unknowingly received from passport buyer,"May 12, 2023 9:21 AM",Rule of law NGO Repubblika has returned a €1500 donation it had unknowingly received from a wealthy individual seeking to purchase Maltese citizenship This came after home affairs minister tabled a list of NGOs who had received a donation from a prospective passport buyer despite not being asked for such a list Subsequently Repubblika said it “never accepted donations from anyone we knew was buying Maltese citizenship” and asked the minister to provide details of the donation so this could be returned Although applicants are obliged to give a donation of at least €10000 to a registered NGO Repubblika received a €1500 donation “At our own request yesterday we were informed by the authorities of the identity of the person who had disclosed that they had given us a donation in the process to acquire Maltese citizenship Yesterday we sent back the donation to that person who had not told us that they were making the donation in the process of buying Maltese citizenship” Repubbkika said on Friday Malta’s controversial cashforpassport scheme allows wealthy individuals to buy EU citizenship in return for around €12 million in investments fees and donations Applicants must submit a receipt of such donations to the agency accompanied by a confirmation from the Commissioner for Voluntary Organisations that the organisation is duly registered However voluntary organisations themselves are not informed that the donation is linked to applications to purchase Maltese citizenship Moreover names of wealthy people who acquire a Maltese passport are published in the annual list of naturalised citizens making it close to impossible to identify applicants who purchased citizenship under the golden passports scheme In its statement on Friday Repubblika reiterated that it opposes the golden passport programme and “we want nothing to do with a scheme which we consider to be immoral and illegal” The NGO also published a letter Repubblika president Robert Aquilina sent to the applicant which reads “We have today reimbursed your €1500 donation of the 13th November 2022 to us after learning from the authorities that it was made as part of the process when applying to become a Maltese citizen” “Though we are happy to welcome new Maltese citizens who make our country their home we disagree that citizenship should be retailed and reserved for very wealthy people while other people at least just as committed to the wellbeing of our community as you  presumably are are excluded because they are less rich” Aquilina also pointed out that Repubblika has been reassured by authorities that the €1500 donation was the only such contribution made by an IIP applicant

Abela questions whether judiciary is applying right sanctions for road crime,"May 11, 2023 4:19 PM",Prime Minister Robert Abela questioned whether courts are handing down judgments that reflect the gravity of road traffic accidents The number of road fatalities during 2022 reached a record 28 up by 19 when compared to the previous year while in the first three months of this year road traffic casualties increased by 133 over the same period in 2022 Speaking to the press at the end of a Cabinet meeting on Thursday Abela pointed out that in cases were victims of road accidents suffer permanent disability courts can impose harsher sentences including effective jail time His comments come in he wake of a number of court sentences in which offenders got away with what commentators and sections of the public said were light sentences Abela noted that the scope of both the criminal code and traffic regulating codes have wide parameters for interpretation that include imposing effective prison sentences Once again putting the onus on the judiciary Abela said it is up to the courts to decide whether to apply them to the letter “My question is is our judiciary imposing sentences that reflect the gravity of the offence Is the jurisprudence of many years ago which allows a perpetrator to leave with a slap on the wrist still valid Or should our courts consider upping the penalty” Abela said While agreeing with the need for more security and stricter enforcement on the roads Abela said the new Chief Executive at Transport Malta will be making this a priority Asked if Malta has a drug driving problem following the death of two people who died after being hit by a motorist under the influence of drugs Abela said he held talks on this issue on several occasions with groups that represent insurance brokers “While there are methods for roadside testing for alcohol use we do not have the same facilities when it comes to testing for drug use” he said Asked if increases in traffic accidents show that it was pointless to increase fines and penalties for traffic contraventions Abela said that the increase in enforcement was the reason why the penalties were increased “More awareness is needed for people to understand that cars are a weapon” Abela said He added that the penalties are already very high and that it is now up to the judiciary to hand down sentences which truly reflect the gravity and circumstances of the case Although Abela said that he cannot interfere in the decisions of the judiciary the prime minister insisted that contraventions are high enough and can only be effective if they are applied consistently Videos Michela Tufigno

"Sudan war: Sudanese in Malta should be given protection, activist says","May 16, 2023 7:00 AM",Videos Miguela Xuereb Sudanese nationals in Malta should be granted some form of protection Hadia Bashir said as she urged the authorities to take action and offer these asylum seekers with some stability Bashir a former politician in Sudan sat down with Newsbookcommt to reflect on the situation in her country after intense clashes between Sudan’s military and country’s main paramilitary force erupted in midApril The clashes saw hundreds of people killed whilst thousands fled the country amid the power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime which has its roots before the 30year dictatorial rule of Omar Al Bashir was brought to an end in 2019 The Sudanese armed forces are broadly loyal to General Abdel Fattah alBurhan the country’s de facto ruler The paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces RSF are a collection of militia under the command of a former warlord General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemediti The RSF also known as Janjaweed was founded by Al Bashir to crush a rebellion in Darfur that began more than 20 years ago It was then transformed into a semiorganised paramilitary force by Al Bashir in 2013 with their leaders being deployed in South Sudan to crush a rebellion In 2019 RSF together with the Sudanese Armed Forces cooperated to oust Al Bashir However efforts to transition to a democratic civilianled government fell through following a coup in October 2021 Speaking to Newsbookcommt Bashir explained that the majority of the Sudanese in Malta are asylum seekers who are seeking for protection “It is now evident why they need protection” Bashir said as she insisted that by offering them some stability the Sudanese in Malta can feel safe and can also help their families back in Sudan “Applications for protection by Sudanese are usually rejected In our community we have a large number of Sudanese whose application has been rejected They are from Darfur and would have moved to Khartoum Now you can see how they are suffering” she said “They should be given some form of protection even temporary protection – it is better than nothing at all” Bashir underlined Describing Sudan as a rich country Bashir reminisced that the people were hopeful after the Al Bashir regime collapsed in 2019 following a 30year dictatorial rule “The hands of Al Bashir are still there” she said and noted that the democratic transition faltered Like diplomats in Khartoum who warned in early 2022 that violence would eventually break out the people of Sudan were expecting something to happen Asked if foreign nations could be involved in what was taking place Bashir said she could not accuse anyone adding that Sudanese suspect the involvement of third parties however it is not yet visible Whilst comparisons are odious the situation in Sudan was compared to the invasion of Ukraine with Bashir describing it “worse” since her conationals were being killed by Sudanese themselves “It is a real disaster Dead bodies on the roads looting and the hospitals are not functioning” she explained Moreover bordering countries are not safe “The countries are not 100 safe and people are waiting for help at the border” she said Bashir also added that there is hardly any media presence in the country documenting what is happening The Sudanese community in Malta is quite sizeable with the members having family back home The clashes brought with them internet outages making it difficult for Sudanese in Malta to reach out to their relatives back home A Sudanese in Malta had five of his family members killed during the clashes The former politician underlined that it was important that the general public in Malta to be aware of what is happening in Sudan “They need to know what is happening in our country and pray for the people in danger” Bashir said and added that Sudan also needed humanitarian assistance “There are organisations that moved in to assist the people in Turkey and Syria now the Sudanese need the same things we would be very grateful if they help out” she said Speaking about her political stint in Sudan Bashir said it was hard to be a woman and a politician representing the opposition party Among the five people elected she was the only woman representing women in the Red Sea state for five years “As a parliament member in an Opposition party you are not protected” Bashir recalled adding that one could easily be jailed because of a differing political opinion However she feels she delivered her message while in office Watch the full interview below

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"Just 4 on SVPR waiting list, while 1,556 seek placement in community homes","May 11, 2023 8:00 AM",That the smaller care homes at the heart of Malta’s localities are more in demand than a placement in Malta’s historic nursing home – the St Vincent de Paul Residence – is perhaps obvious but statistics tabled in parliament appear to make this difference particularly stark At present minister Jo Etienne Abela confirmed in a reply to a parliamentary question by opposition MP Graziella Attard Previ there are 1556 people on the waiting list for one of Malta’s various community homes In contrast the waiting list for SVPR comprises just four persons the oldest pending application dates back to 8 March Abela confirmed in reply to a related question by Attard Previ The difference in numbers in part reflects the fact that SVPR is by far the largest care home in the country with a population of over 1100 residents But as one may expect many seeking placements in communitybased care homes are not necessarily seeking a placement in any of the various homes across the Maltese islands but in a care home that is in or close to their hometown
"No Comino beach concessions, only ‘encroachments’","May 11, 2023 7:00 AM",Tourism minister Clayton Bartolo’s assertion last week that there are no beach concessions in Comino was an exercise in semantics the agreements allowing operators to fill Blue Lagoon with deckchairs are “encroachments” Bartolo had said last month that the existing concessions at Blue Lagoon would be extended without a tender since the government had yet to finalise a longterm plan for the site prompting Nationalist Party MP Albert Buttigieg to ask for a copy of the documents extending these agreements But last week Bartolo replied simply that “there is no concession in Comino” On Wednesday however his answer to a question by PN MP Rebekah Borg – who similarly asked for a copy of the documents – saw Bartolo address the apparent confusion “Due to the changes that have taken place to address the situation at Blue Lagoon there has been no extension to the concessions” the minister said The changes include a pledge to limit deckchairs to a third of the Blue Lagoon area “To improve the management of the area encroachments were granted to the same operators that were present last summer” he added seemingly entrusting the same operators behind last summer’s abuses to address the problem they have caused Bartolo said that government would take note of the results obtained by the changes to finalise a “holistic plan” for Blue Lagoon No copy of the encroachment agreements was provided to Borg The different terminology however may serve another purpose last month the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that beach concessions should not be renewed automatically but must be subject to an impartial and transparent selection procedure Presenting the existing agreement as an encroachment may thus be an attempt to skirt what the CJEU considers to be a requirement of EU law The minister had already justified the extension of the concession to the deckchair operators – by that or any other name – on the grounds that no such plan had yet been finalised Past indications however suggest that longterm plans for Comino have not exactly been a priority for the authorities A carrying capacity exercise for the chronicallyovercrowded swimming spot is now 7 years overdue it should have been carried out by 2016 according to the management plan for the Natura 2000 site comprising the entirety of Comino and its islets

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Konrad Mizzi dismisses NAO report as ‘blatantly false’,"May 15, 2023 8:09 PM",Former Labour minister Konrad Mizzi dismissed the damning National Audit Report which concluded that he had misled the Cabinet of ministers over the hospitals concession deal as “pure conjecture irresponsible and blatantly false” Mizzi’s tirade against the NAO comes despite his refusal to cooperate with the investigation with the report saying that the former minister’s failure to cooperate was “inexcusable” The report concluded that Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” However in a Facebook post on Monday Mizzi denied this and insisted that Cabinet held lengthy discussion at various stages of the concession deal “Some context is necessary On the 26th August 2019 I had briefed Cabinet that terms for credit facilities from BOV were discussed and that BOV was seeking additional safeguards The memorandum to Cabinet clearly stated that in the event of a court declaration of nullity of the concession government would become liable to pay the lender’s debt and would trigger a government event of default” Mizzi claimed He added that this was deemed necessary following discussions with the Ministry of Finance Bank of Valletta and other stakeholders “Lengthy discussions took place in Cabinet on the implications of both lender’s debt and a government’s event of default and I answered all questions raised by my peers as the then Prime Minister who chaired the meeting himself confirms” he said in reference to Joseph Muscat Muscat himself had attempted to shift blame of the deal which court said is fraudulent on to his ministers Reacting to the court judgment in February Muscat claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and decisions by the Cabinet However former minister Evarist Bartolo refuted Muscat’s claims and said ”Following comments about the cabinet in reaction to the court’s ruling on the hospital’s deal with foreign companies is it fair to use the cabinet as a smokescreen” Bartolo also told Times of Malta that the hospital deal details were not discussed in Cabinet and “the devil is in the details” Moreover the court judgment which annulled the concessions pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
PA shoots down developer’s attempt to keep St Paul’s Bay street bottleneck,"May 10, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Planning Authority board has turned down a developer’s request to change street alignments close to an apartment block he built in St Paul’s Bay – keeping a longstanding bottleneck that he was bound to clear before actually building the complex Angelo Spiteri breached permit conditions when he went ahead with the construction on Sqaq taxXama’ which leads from St Paul’s Bay’s centre to the locality’s primary school an enforcement case had been launched by the PA as a result and daily fine payments are due Spiteri had received two permits to build his apartment block with the second amending the first but both specified that construction of the apartment block could not begin before Spiteri cleared the existing obstruction and the junction of Sqaq taxXama’ and Triq San Ġwann ilBattista is widened in line with the approved alignment The obstruction in this case is an old rural residence that is over a century old it appears in the 1900 edition of the Ordnance Survey maps When Spiteri was granted his permits the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage had no objections to the structure’s demolition maintaining that despite its age it had no traditional architectural features worth preserving In a planning control application however Spiteri sought to shift the building alignments keeping the existing bottlenecks in place retaining the older parts of the structure and demolishing later accretions This application was set to extend the apartment block’s front garden and gave no indication of whether the remaining parts of the rural structure would serve any purpose Curiously this time round the SCH “favourably noted” his proposal to retain what’s left of the structure whilst giving its blessing to the demolition of “an accretion that has no value” It also said that the existing road “appears wide enough to service very large vehicles let alone normal vehicular use” The street width according to the case officer’s report is reduced to 408m at its narrowest point A group of residents in the area however strongly objected to the plans and the St Paul’s Bay local council also insisted that the bottleneck be addressed suggesting by way of compromise the possibility of relocating the rural structure Mayor Alfred Grima had emphasised that the structure and the bottleneck that ensued was endangering the many schoolchildren who walked to the school further down the street In any case only around a sixth of the complex has been preserved the rest has been demolished to make way for Spiteri’s apartment block An inspection found restoration or maintenance works being carried out on the remnants of the original structure in apparent preparation for PA’s acceptance of Spiteri’s request these works were unauthorised the case officer assigned to the application pointed out The case officer also highlighted the inconsistency of the SCH’s position recalling its previous blessing for the demolition of the structure whose remnants it was now seeking to preserve The residents objecting to the plans meanwhile argued that the remaining structure was not the part visible in the 1900 Ordnance Survey map but later addition the oldest part had been demolished by Spiteri In his report the case officer also pointed out that the planning control application could have been avoided altogether had Spiteri not breached the conditions of his permit But ultimately his recommendation to refuse Spiteri’s request centred solely on traffic concerns “The proposed change to the official alignment through the retention of the existing structure hinders the continuation of the smooth schemed road alignment thus conflicting with the road safety and traffic circulation in the area” he wrote as he recommended refusal a recommendation the PA executive council proved happy to accept

"4 Freeport employees jailed, fined €6.7m each over theft of container","May 9, 2023 3:56 PM",Four Malta Freeport employees were jailed and fined close to €67 million apiece after being convicted over the theft of a container filled with 105 million cigarettes that took place in 2015 Two separate criminal proceedings were launched against the four men which were both brought to a close with a sentence by Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech on Tuesday In one of the cases the magistrate jailed security officer Christopher Calleja a 59yearold Valletta resident to a 4year jail term while haulier Malcolm Zammit a 44yearold from Qormi was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment The other case ended with customs officer Sebastian Zammit a 67yearold from Safi and Freeport employee Roderick Borg a 40yearold from Qormi jailed for three years and two years respectively All four men were fined €6686055 apiece of which a third €2228685 is being considered civil damages that should be paid to the Customs Department Each was charged with the theft of a container laden with cigarettes and with defrauding the government and Customs of the taxes and excise duties due on the sale of the cigarettes The container contained 1050 cases each containing 10000 cigarettes which were valued at €304500 According to the applicable rates at the time their sale should have netted €1666875 in excise duty €175392 in import duties and €38641806 in VAT Calleja and Zammit were also separately charged with committing a crime they were dutybound to prevent given their particular duties at the Malta Freeport The case centres around a container which arrived in Malta on 24 July 2015 which was taken out of the Freeport and returned to its original location within a couple of hours which were replaced by bricks The container was not intended for Malta the Malta Freeport is primarily a transhipment hub with the vast majority of unloaded cargo ending up loaded onto another vessel The container was driven out on a trailer truck by Malcolm Zammit with Sebastian Zammit and Calleja deemed to have failed to carry out the verifications they should have on its contents Borg meanwhile had operated the reach stacker that loaded the container onto the trailer truck he should have been working in a completely different section of the Freeport at the time The magistrate concluded that the evidence in hand – including security camera footage – left her with no doubt that all four were involved in the crime stating that all four’s active involvement was necessary for their plan to succeed “When the time came for them to do their part they did so in synchrony with one another and worked in perfect synergy It is this synergy that saw a container meant for transhipment loaded on a trailer leave without any controls… unloaded its cargo replaced by bricks returned to the Freeport and put in its original place” Frendo Dimech said in one of her sentences “In less than two hours this operation was carried out in broad daylight and in the presence of other workers and operators” The whole operation she continued would have failed had any of the four men not been privy to the criminal conspiracy “This did not happen and the operation was a success because the defendants Roderick Borg Sebastian Zammit and Christopher Calleja all carried out their role in an impeccable manner so that thanks to their actions Malcolm Zammit could leave the Freeport with a container full of cigarettes” she observed The prosecution was led by inspectors Rennie Stivala and Carlos Cordina from the Economic Crimes Unit
PA insists Paola road will retain two-storey streetscape,"May 9, 2023 3:24 PM",The streetscape in Cospicua Road in Paola will remain that of two storeys the Planning Authority PA said on Tuesday In January the authority approved a full development permission application which falls in two streets Cospicua Road and Triq ilQalb ta’ Ġesu for the demolition of the existing property and the construction of a substation garage and 17 apartments including two penthouses while preserving the original façade In a statement on Tuesday said there is an approximate height difference of one storey between the two streets adding that the massing of the approved project is focused on Triq ilQalb ta’ Ġesu’ “The development on Triq Bormla which is characterised by twostorey dwellings and is within the urban conservation area UCA of Paola will only be that of a receded floor as is permissible in all UCAs In fact the approved plans include the retention and restoration of the existing façade” the PA said The statement comes in the wake of of a public disagreement between Paola local councillors This week the council issued a statement largely defending plans for the 17apartment complex behind the backs of the majority of the locality’s councillors No less than four of Paola’s seven local councillors – including the deputy mayor – ended up publicly disassociating themselves from the statement and clarifying that it was drafted without their knowledge let alone approval The prospect of a project that could compromise the visual integrity of Cospicua Road has raised the concerns of many Paola residents with many expressing their disgust on social media But echoing the local council’s statement the PA insisted that that the majority of the studio apartments will overlook Triq ilQalb ta’ Ġesu’ which street falls outside the UCA and is characterised by buildings of various heights The authority explained that it approved the development of 1bedroom studio apartments because the site falls within a Student Priority Area given that it is in the vicinity of MCAST NGO Din lArt Helwa objected to the development in view of the proposed volumes and resultant impact on the visual integrity of the space The area surrounding the site has an established height limitation of two floors and three floors plus basement and a number of Paola residents said the project will jar with the rest of the townscape But according to the authority the proposed development is acceptable since the proposal complies with the height limitation car parking requirements and design considerations The applicant is Silvan Mizzi who has extensive business ties to Gozitan construction magnate Joseph Portelli including in the Mercury Towers project and who is part of the Ħamrun Spartans FC executive board The architect behind this project is Maria Schembri Grima the former chair of the Building and Construction Authority set up to regulate the construction industry Schembri Grima is frequently involved in development projects involving Portelli and his business associates and previously headed the authority entrusted with regulating him and his peers However in February of this year she resigned over the glaring conflict of interest which hit the headlines after the agency she led was constrained to stop dangerous demolition works in a project she is leading in her private capacity as an architect
Tax and customs departments to merge as new strategy launched,"May 9, 2023 2:09 PM",The Office of the Commissioner for Revenue CfR has launched a threeyear strategic plan which will see the Income Tax Value Added Tax and the Customs departments merging into a single entity The strategy covering the period 2023 to 2025 is aimed at transforming the CfR into an modern administration making better use of technology This will be achieved through the merging of the departments responsible for Income Tax Value Added Tax and the Customs Department The new entity will be known as the Malta Tax and Customs Administration Finance minister Clyde Caruana welcomed the strategic plan which he said is the product of two years of intensive work The strategy is intended to ensure that our country does more with less by making better use of existing revenue and that all taxes due are collected he said “Indeed the mindset of delayed payments and systematic noncompliance needs to change for the sake of good governance and fairness An increase in compliance and efficiency would also allow Malta’s tax burden to remain relatively low in comparison to European counterparts thus sustaining economic development and labour market growth” Caruana said

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul said Predictably he went on to suggest that the government would resist this and do the opposite
New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”
Tumuluri claims he was warned ‘he’d end up like Daphne’ by Keith Schembri,"May 17, 2023 6:55 PM",Former Vitals Global Healthcare direct Ram Tumuluri agreed to transfer the hospitals concession after receiving “death threats of ending up like Daphne Caruana Galizia” by former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s righthand man Keith Schembri Tumuluri made the claim in an official disclosure to the US authorities which was obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with partners in Malta The Shift and The Times of Malta The shocking claims come as Tumuluri wants whistleblower protection in the US to reveal alleged coercion threats and corrupt practices by disgraced firmer prime minister Joseph Muscat’s government in the hospitals deal According to the reports published on Wednesday evening Tumuluri filed a whistleblower complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act In his complaint Tumuluri alleged that he was repeatedly threatened by Schembri and others that he would meet the same end as journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia if he didn’t sign the hospitals’ concession over to Steward Healthcare The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Tumuluri claimed the threats were made by Schembri thenhealth minister Konrad Mizzi and one of the concession’s original brokers Shaukat Ali among others In March 2015 journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had first reported that the government had struck a deal with Oxley Capital Group of Singapore ahead of the call for proposals for the privatisation of three of Malta’s state hospitals and that representatives of the company – including Ram Tumuluri – had visited Malta two months earlier for meetings The concession agreement covering the running of St Luke’s Karin Grech and Gozo General Hospitals was awarded to VGH in 2015 The deal was later described as “collusion” between the government in the pretender phase The former VGH director also said that Muscat played a role in what Tumuluri claims was a forced handover of the concession to Steward for €1 Both Muscat and Schembri denied the claims Tumuluri also accused Steward Healthcare of engaging in unlawful activity with the government of Malta and insisted he only signed the concession over because he was made to fear for his life by government officials and others working on their behalf The 505page complaint includes an affidavit from Tumuluri and hundreds of pages of supporting documents such as internal emails contracts and project plans In his complaint to US authorities Tumuluri said the threats lasted through the period of the journalist’s assassination in October 2017 until he eventually caved into demands in December 2017 and signed the concession over because he feared his life and that of his family would be in danger if he didn’t According to Tumuluri’s disclosure Schembri warned him that “he is the law in Malta” and that no agreement could protect Tumuluri’s interest Schembri allegedly warned that “if the government could silence a vocal reporter like Ms Caruana Galizia Mr Tumuluri should be very careful not to make enemies with the government” Moreover Tumuluri alleged that during a meeting at Castille Schembri told him “You know what happened with Daphne Caruana Galizia and you don’t want to end up in that position You want us to be a friend not a foe” Tumuluri also disclosed several meetings in which he alleges his life had been threatened and claims he was pulled aside afterwards from one such meeting  by Mizzi who warned him “Don’t force these guys to go to that level”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country

Victor Zammit elected to Xagħra council after mayor Christian Zammit’s resignation,"May 9, 2023 12:05 PM",Victor Zammit has been elected to the Xagħra local council in a casual election held after the resignation of its mayor Christian Zammit who had been publicly critical of overdevelopment and the state of Gozo’s natural and built environment Victor Zammit who had been a member of his hometown’s local council between 2012 and 2015 was the only candidate to put his name forward in the casual election with the only other unsuccessful Labour candidate in the 2019 election Samuel Xerri choosing not to put his name forward The locality’s new mayor is Aaron Agius the Labour candidate who had obtained the most firstcount votes after Christian Zammit in the 2019 election which saw Xagħra residents elect four Labour candidates and a single Nationalist one to represent them Christian Zammit had also resigned from Labour’s Gozo regional committee with immediate effect emphasising in his announcement that the resignation was no easy step given that he had been involved in politics for 23 years While Zammit did not state the reasons behind his resignation his opposition to overdevelopment at the hands of developers seemingly favoured by the party in government has widely been interpreted as a key motivating factor Zammit had also unsuccessfully contested last year’s general election and had suggested that a scaremongering campaign by the construction industry had impacted his performance Prime minister Robert Abela had said that he would be seeking to persuade Zammit to change his mind but any efforts undertaken proved futile
"Metsola, Agius Saliba ranked among 100 most influential MEPs","May 9, 2023 11:20 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Two Maltese MEPs have been ranked among the 100 most influential MEPs during this parliamentary term in an exercise carried out by EUfocused thinktank EU Matrix this year Perhaps predictably the topranked Maltese MEP is the present president of the European Parliament – the Nationalist Party MEP Roberta Metsola Metsola was ranked second on the list being surpassed by fellow European People’s Party MEP Manfred Weber Weber a member of the Christian Social Union party in the German region of Bavaria is the chair of the EPP group which is the largest political grouping in the EP He is also the president of the EPP itself Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba was ranked 35th with EU Matrix attributing this primarily to his status as one of the vicepresidents of the Socialists and Democrats group as vicechair of the Petitions Committee and his active involvement on digital and social policy files Agius Saliba was considered the eighth most influential SD MEP as may be expected the most influential was the group’s chair the Spanish MEP Iratxe García Pérez who is also the president of the Party of European Socialists she was ranked third In its report EU Matrix specifically cited Malta as an example of a small national delegation able to punch above its own weight even if larger countries naturally exerted the most influence within the European Parliament In fact Malta’s six MEPs obtained the highest average influence score of any national delegation at 4032 followed by Luxembourg 3733 and Finland 3426 The EPP is considered to be the most influential political grouping with a total influence score of 61617 followed by the SD 51644 and the liberal Renew Europe group 37547 These scores reflect each group’s relative size as the average influence of each group’s MEPs was considerably similar Renew’s MEPs punched above their weight the most with an average influence score of 368 though closely followed by SD 359 and the EPP 351 The Greens are next with an average score of 327 followed by The Left 327 and the conservative ECR group 257 The least influential MEPs are those affiliated with the farright ID group 153 which actually obtained a lower score than the noninscrits who belong to no political group 155 This reflects what can be described as a cordon sanitaire subjected by the other groups which prevents farright MEPs from obtaining leadership positions or playing a prominent role in negotiations on important files EU Matrix emphasised that its scores are not meant to suggest “which MEPs are ‘better’ than others but rather which MEPs have found themselves due to a combination of personal and circumstantial factors in positions from which they have been able to influence EU policy” advising the public to also assess the direction in which individuals were influencing policy Its findings – both on an individual and on a national level – were nevertheless welcomed by Agius Saliba as a sign that Maltese MEPs “are leaving a very positive impact on a European level” The Labour MEP said that he was satisfied to be considered to be among the mostpolitically influential MEPs in what is his first term stating that this only pushed him further in his efforts to work in the best interest of the Maltese at a European level
Paola council defends controversial Cospicua Road project behind councillors’ backs,"May 9, 2023 10:28 AM",The Paola local council has issued a statement largely defending plans for a 17apartment complex on a property that has frontage on Cospicua Road a street lined by traditional twostorey townhouses behind the backs of the majority of the locality’s councillors No less than four of Paola’s seven local councillors – including the deputy mayor – ended up publicly disassociating themselves from the statement and clarifying that it was drafted without their knowledge let alone approval The application to demolish the existing property – retaining the original façade – to build a 5storey studio apartment block was made by Silvan Mizzi a business associate of the notorious Gozitan construction magnate Joseph Portelli The project’s architect is Maria Schembri Grima the former chair of the Building and Construction Authority who resigned the position in disgrace earlier this year after a dangerous demolition at a project she was leading Despite objections by Din lArt Ħelwa and the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage who questioned the proposed demolition of the interior of the townhouse within Paola’s Urban Conservation Area the case officer deemed the project acceptable since it complied with planning policy primarily since the additional stories were set to be added outside the UCA Accordingly a development permit was issued on January A request for reconsideration has been made by the developer in a bid to reduce the contribution due to the shortfall in parking provisions that the building would create and it is set to be decided on Friday But the prospect of a project that could compromise the visual integrity of Cospicua Road has raised the concerns of many Paola residents with many expressing their disgust on social media These comments appear to have spurred the local council to react though the manner in which it has done so appears to have only served to sow division within the local council itself The statement itself highlights that a meeting took place on Monday involving mayor Dominic Grima executive secretary Kurt Scerri and the local council’s architect giving no indication that other councillors were involved in the process The apparent defence of a controversial development that ensued not only earned the council no favours but also drew outraged reactions from the majority of the local council Deputy mayor Darren Lynch and councillors Steven Axisa Neville Camilleri and Rita Delezio all emphasised that they had not endorsed the statement and that they were not even involved in the process leading to it Delezio is one of two Nationalist Party councillors on the 7member council while all other three are members of the Labour Party as is Grima himself Delezio was the only councillor to explicitly state that she was against the proposed development Camilleri declared that he had asked Scerri to convene an urgent meeting over the matter and informed that this required a councillor to second his proposal Consequently he could not understand how a meeting subsequently took place in his – and other councillors’ – absence The council’s defence of the project centres primarily on the fact that the proposed massing will mainly take place on the side facing Triq Qalb ta’ Ġesù which falls outside the UCA area even though it is largely characterised by traditional twostorey townhouses The lack of UCA protection has seen a number of apartment blocks go up in in the same street though none reach the scale of the proposed development to date This fact was not lost by the Paola residents who reacted to the council’s statement with several arguing that the streetscape of Triq Qalb ta’ Ġesù also deserved protection

Copy-pasted recommendations: detention centre concerns unaddressed for years,"May 9, 2023 8:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Most of the recommendations made in the last annual report of the Monitoring Board for Detained Persons are nothing new many have been repeated year after year as the authorities fail to address concerns about conditions in Malta’s detention centres for asylum seekers The board’s annual reports are submitted to the minister responsible for home affairs and are not automatically made public The 2021 and 2022 reports were only published on Monday through a parliamentary question made by Nationalist MP Albert Buttigieg to minister Byron Camilleri Though the board monitors detention centres that are the minister’s political responsibility its members are themselves political appointees chosen by the same minister Its present chair is former Labour candidate Simon Micallef Stafrace the son of former minister Joe Micallef Stafrace The board is empowered to visit detention centres without prior notice with members making 23 visits to the Safi detention centre last year In its reports the board emphasised that the detention authorities were fully cooperative though independent NGOs actively involved in migrant and refugee issues – including aditus and Jesuit Refugee Service Malta – have long complained that their staff are routinely denied access to the individuals they wish to assist The board concluded its 2021 report with an overall positive assessment while the 2022 report’s conclusion took a more neutral stance emphasising that the board’s 5 parttime members were not sufficient to cover their duties But the many repeated recommendations often copypasted from one year to the next make clear that many concerns about the conditions asylum seekers – many seemingly flagged through the interviews board members had with detainees – are not a priority for the authorities Perhaps tellingly reports going at least as far back as 2018 feature just one phrase that is bolded for effect “as in previous reports the board had already recommended various measures aimed at improving the quality of life of detained persons and the detention centres and some of these are reproduced below” No less than 10 of the 15 recommendations made in the 2021 report are repeated practically word for word in the subsequent report as are 4 of the 9 recommendations made in 2018 But many of the concerns highlighted in the other recommendations – including concerns about the food quality – also repeat themselves A refurbishment programme is ongoing in Safi as the government had announced in 2021 during a visit by the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatović – who deemed conditions in Safi to be “deplorable” But the 2022 report highlighted that the room used for the distribution of food supplies is “totally unhygienic” The board has long called for the provision of a list of contracted interpreters to facilitate communication between detainees and staff and to incentivise staff who wish to learn specific languages to better communicate with detainees Another concern longignored by the authority is the paucity of means by which detainees can entertain themselves and communicate with the outside world Year after year the board has recommended the setting up of a computer room for this purpose – as detention centres overseas have done – but their call has fallen on deaf ears Similarly ignored for years is a proposal to set up a designated area for sports and training The board has also long called for detainees to be granted the possibility to be included in schemes that prisoners at the Corradino Correctional Facility can avail themselves of particularly those allowing them to carry out selected duties which would be beneficial “from a financial point of view but most of all a mental health point of view” Again there is no indication that the authorities are willing to entertain such a request Another recommendation aiming at improving the wellbeing of detainees is to grant them the opportunity to spend a number of hours per day outside – more than the minimum requirements But to do so properly all yards needed to be equipped with a shelter and a means of rest Despite the psychologically taxing situation detainees are kept in detainees have been repeatedly found to lack proper access to psychiatric and psychological assistance along with dentistry The board has also repeatedly called for custodial staff to receive first aid training But arguably one of the most concerning repeated recommendations by the board suggests that staff receive recurrent training which would include “a clear message that the use of excessive force and any verbal abuse as well as any form of disrespectful or provocative behaviour will not be tolerated” Then again as the recommendations that had been made by Mijatović after her 2021 visit suggest the main concern may well be one outside the limited scope of the board Malta’s practice of detaining those who seek asylum – a fundamental human right – for months on end Mijatović had insisted that Malta should immediately act to “avoid the arbitrary detention of asylum seekers and migrants” and suggested “investing in alternatives to migrant detention improving safeguards against the detention of vulnerable persons and ensuring that any detention of minors is immediately ended” As is the case with most of the board’s suggestions however Mijatović’s recommendation also predictably fell on deaf ears

revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he

“Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting

Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he

PN to hold national protest on Wednesday,"May 16, 2023 6:55 PM",The Nationalist Party will be holding national protest outside parliament on Wednesday following the damning NAO report on the hospitals privatisation deal Speaking in parliament on Tuesday evening PN leader Bernard Grech said the protest is being called as prime minister Robert Abela continues to undermine the country’s institutions The Opposition has held a series of protests after court annulled the deal which it said was fraudulent in February The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In recent days the PN has asked police chief Angelo Gafa to launch a criminal investigation on the individuals involved in the deal including Mizzi and Muscat however the police force has so far failed to react Moreover on Monday Abela chose to respond to the damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it by breaching parliamentary rules Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on the embarrassing report saw him bring it up in parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon with government rejecting a suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday Moreover on Tuesday the Labour Party held a press conference in which minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul insisted that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"Archbishop quotes St Ġorġ Preca: for many, God remains a ‘great zero’","May 7, 2023 2:11 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Archbishop Charles Scicluna quoted a lament often cited by St Ġorġ Preca – that “for many God is a great zero” – as he celebrated mass on Sunday highlighting that the same concern was as relevant today The Archbishop was celebrating mass at the Parish Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in FleurdeLys a locality that held a particular significance for Dun Ġorġ It was in a field in the area that Dun Ġorġ then a young priest began instructing his first disciple Ġeġe Borg who subsequently became the first superiorgeneral of the Society of Christian Doctrine MUSEUM Accordingly he referred to the saint’s teachings in his homily linking them to the gospel of the day John’s account of Jesus comforting his disciples and explaining that the way to God the father was through him Jesus he said answered a question many had when faced with the death of a loved one or when reflecting on their own mortality “All this struggle all this sacrifice attending mass trying to live a good life what is it for Is there something waiting for me” As the Archbishop recalled Jesus had told his disciples that “my Father’s house has many rooms” and that he would not have come to “prepare a place” for them if that were not so “How beautiful how comforting it is that we can understand that this is the point of death of the departure of our loved ones a moment that always breaks our hearts and scares us” he said The Archbishop said that a place in heaven was reserved for everyone the choice was in everyone’s hand But he added “if you choose the path of love and forgiveness you are safe… forgiveness after all is an expression of love” The way forward to avoid any undue worries he continued is to “devote your life soul and heart to Jesus” But as he reflected on this conclusion the Archbishop questioned whether all that the faithful were doing – including through the work done in parishes – was helping to achieve this goal It is at this point that he referred St Ġorġ Preca recalling that he had listened to all the speeches that had been recorded by MUSEUM members as he sought to understand the saint’s life and teachings These speeches he observed revealed that among the aphorisms that the saint was fond of repeating was a common complaint that for many “God is a great zero” that it is as though he did not exist “We remember this saying with a broken heart for many people God is still a great zero” But then he continued one can also remember his prayer “Dear Lord I need you” which reflected Jesus’ words to all his disciples “This is the word of comfort that our Lord gives us today Not a law not a command but a name Jesus ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled Believe in God believe also in me’” he said “Believe in Jesus”

"‘Compromised’ PM cannot address cost of living, Grech insists","May 7, 2023 12:40 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Sunday that the government was unable to address the deep impact of a fastrising cost of living because a “compromised” prime minister Robert Abela had other worries to deal with including internal party rifts and the fact that he was “captured” by people who had dirt on him Grech was addressing a PN political activity in Għargħur and ahead of his address a similar argument was made by the party’s secretarygeneral Michael Piccinino who said that Abela “is too preoccupied with his and his friends’ scandals” to address the cost of living and other concerns The PN leader then drove the point home focusing on the various controversies that have emerged in recent months to depict Abela as someone who was trying to project serenity and strength and failing miserably in the attempt “The more powerful he attempts to appear the more people realise that he is weak confused and worried” Grech said “And how can he not worry with all the internal divisions in his party” The PN leader suggested that these internal divisions largely emerged since the Labour Party under Abela has discarded all socialist policies The PM he said was failing to lead and offer solutions because “he is compromised he is captured” “But he is captured only because there are things these people can reveal” he added “And this is why he is not serene why he is perplexed why he is preoccupied with protecting Joseph Muscat Konrad Mizzi Keith Schembri Chris Cardona and others” Grech insisted however that other Labour MPs could not be let off the hook “because every time we went to Parliament with a motion concerning a corrupt deal we found Labour MPs defending it” In the meantime he said Malta’s young were losing hope in a decent future in the country not least since their housing prospects were becoming more precarious with every passing year He insisted that this problem was largely brought on by the government which pursued numerous policies – including largescale importation of foreign workers and the sale of citizenship tied to the acquisition or rental of property – which only served to drive prices up at the expense of the general public “How can you be surprised when many young see no future in this country when many leave because they cannot find a place to live in” he asked

Government would already have legalised abortion if it wanted to – Agius Galea,"May 7, 2023 10:53 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The government would have just gone ahead and introduced abortion had it ever intended to do so according to Labour backbench MP Malcolm Paul Agius Galea The Żebbuġ MP was being interviewed on Andrew Azzopardi on 103 when he was questioned on the bill which would amend Malta’s strict antiabortion legislation to specify that no crime is being committed “when the termination of a pregnancy results from a medical intervention aimed at protecting the health of a pregnant woman suffering from a medical complication which may put her life at risk or her health in grave jeopardy” The bill was approved in its second reading along party lines last December but the process has since stalled with a government rattled by various controversies seemingly in no rush to proceed on what has proven to be a politicallycontentious topic Amendments have already been promised with the apparent attempt of addressing concerns by those opposed to abortion that the proposed provisions could be abused but have yet to be made public During the interview Agius Galea conceded that the government could have held a wider consultation process before forging ahead with the bill highlighting the government’s acceptance of the need to amend the bill that was approved His insistence that the government would have already introduced abortion if it planned to came in response to suggestions that this was the government’s ultimate intention the government has no plans to remove the provisions criminalising abortion the MP maintained Nevertheless the MP questioned whether Malta wanted to remain one of very few countries that prohibited abortion in all circumstances – as the law currently stands even in cases where a pregnancy can prove fatal to a woman – and emphasised that the ban did not actually stop abortions from happening “The PM had said that an abortion takes place every day but I suspect that the number is even higher” he said The MP a family doctor by profession was also asked about the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses’ ongoing dispute with the government over its members’ salaries and working conditions in the public health sector leading the union to call widespread industrial action which is presently suspended Agius Galea highlighted that the MUMN was doing its duty as a trade union emphasising that no one wanted their trade union to be a pushover The MUMN’s members he explained expected their union to defend their interests forcefully and in this light industrial action was an obvious course of action when previous attempts at resolving a dispute failed Nevertheless he suggested that trade unions may resort to strikes a little too liberally and questioned why strikes are called only for them to be suspended when talks begin “couldn’t these have taken place before” he asked The MP also observed that it is particularly challenging to negotiate collective agreements with certain entities given the various interests involved The court’s cancellation of the hospitals concession first granted to Vitals and then passed on to Steward Health Care was also discussed with Agius Galea conceding that this concession could have been handled better The MP emphasised that Steward’s failure to deliver the promised investment in the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital St Luke’s Hospital and Karin Grech Hospital – was unacceptable even if it did deliver healthcare services properly Agius Galea insisted that the government’s intentions in pushing for the were noble decentralising Malta’s healthcare system and ease the pressure on Mater Dei Hospital “The only ones never to make a mistake are those who do nothing though this was a huge mistake” the MP said Despite everything he added one had to admit that the concession did see a marked improvement of the level of service at the Gozo hospital

Malta drops six places in press freedom index,"May 3, 2023 9:08 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Malta’s press freedom continued to deteriorate in the past year according to Reporters Without Borders’ annual World Press Freedom Index with the country slipping down six places when compared to 2022 Published on Wednesday RSF’s 2020 World Press Freedom Index places Malta in the 84th spot six places lower than in 2022 The purpose of the World Press Freedom Index is to compare the level of freedom enjoyed by journalists and media in 180 countries and territories RSF and its panel of experts define press freedom as “the ability of journalists as individuals and collectives to select produce and disseminate news in the public interest independent of political economic legal and social interference and in the absence of threats to their physical and mental safety Journalists in Malta have to cope with a highly polarised environment under the strong influence of political parties an analysis of the index noted Despite the public inquiry into the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was concluded in 2021 the index notes that the government was reluctant to implement the recommendations listed in the inquiry report The inquiry had concluded that the state must shoulder responsibility for the assassination because it created an atmosphere of impunity Almost six years from the assassination of Caruana Galizia full justice is yet to be served the report notes In 2022 Alfred and George Degiorgio pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 40 years in prison Earlier their accomplice Vince Muscat pleaded guilty following a plea deal and was also jailed for 15 years However the masterminds and others involved in the crime have yet to be convicted It was observed that the ruling party – the Labour Party – wields a strong influence over the public broadcaster It also makes use of public advertising to exert pressure on private media “Many politicians select specific journalists for exclusive interviews while those considered “hostile” are ignored including within the party media The government requires an “access card” issued to journalists to cover government events or attend press conferences” the country report reads As for Malta’s legal framework while press freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution the country’s legal and regulatory framework does not allow journalists to exercise their rights It was observed that the independent media are discriminated against in accessing information with the local authorities have gone so far as to challenge in court each of the 40 requests for access to information sent by a media outlet effectively targeting it with a new type of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation SLAPP Journalists are regularly the targets of SLAPP and family members of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia killed in 2017 are even targeted with posthumous defamation lawsuits It was also noted that while it is relatively easy to launch a media outlet the small market offers limited sources of funding for independent media whose sustainability is undermined by nontransparent and discriminatory distribution of public funds The report notes that the subsidies offered during the coronavirus pandemic were mostly granted to political parties’ media outlets On almost every issue of public interest Maltese society suffers from deep polarization “Reporting on certain topics such as migration or abortion remains unpopular and incites abuse towards journalists covering these topics Very few journalists from minority groups work for the mainstream media Investigative reporting is carried out by a handful of journalists almost exclusively men” In a statement to mark the occasion of World Press Freedom Day the Institute of Maltese Journalists IĠM called on government to tangibly create an environment where journalists and media actors can continue carrying out their duty to serve democracy The institute noted recent statements by prime minister Robert Abela that the media is the fourth pillar of democracy as acknowledged in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto IĠM said it expects the government to put its money where its mouth is and really with facts recognise it as such “In the light of such statements it is indeed baffling how the government continues to push back on a recommendation by its own committee of experts to entrench the media in the enforceable parts of the country’s constitution” The institute also called on government to address other issues that are seriously undermining the media in Malta primary among them is the Freedom of Information Act which it said is weak abused by the public authorities and in dire need of a total overhaul Along with this is a shift in mentality whereby information is given rather than kept under wraps “Other issues include the considerable financial difficulties being faced by media outlets The IĠM is looking at models used abroad and will be making its recommendations to government in this regard” “The IĠM is evolving into the firstever journalists’ trade union in Malta giving it and its members a strong

"Malta failed to rescue nearly 7,500 people in distress last year – report","May 3, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Malta’s apparent policy of largely ignoring distress calls by potential asylum seekers have seen it fail to rescue no less than 7459 people in distress last year according to statistics compiled for the European Council of Refugees and Exiles ECRE During the same period the country was also accused of being involved in 14 pushbacks – which fall foul of international law – involving a total of 789 people according to the 2022 country report on Malta prepared as part of the Asylum Information Database AIDA The report was compiled by aditus one of two Maltese members of the ECRE alliance which brings together 110 NGOs from 40 European countries the other is the Jesuit Refugee Service Malta Claims that Malta was failing to respond to distress calls in the area it is responsible for have long been made by NGOs active in rescues including Alarm Phone which operates an independent hotline that has effectively a key contact point for people attempting the central Mediterranean route in their bid to reach safety in Europe Earlier this year criticism of Malta’s apparent policy has been taken up by members of the Italian government with the parliamentary leader of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni’s party accusing Malta of “pretending not to see” people in its SAR area a charge which Malta has denied The AIDA report compiled all instances in which Malta appears to have failed to intervene last year finding that most cases in which Malta did not intervene took place between October and December Malta is estimated to have ignored distress calls concerning no less than 4400 people during those three months And while many appear to have reached Italy – or be rescued by Italian authorities – and hundreds of others were allegedly pushed back with Malta’s assistance hundreds of people remain unaccounted for in the seas Malta is responsible for In comparison the UN’s refugee agency the UNHCR recorded 444 sea arrivals in Malta including 409 who were disembarked by the Armed Forces of Malta after rescue at sea 12 persons were airlifted by the AFM while at least 23 arrived spontaneously The people arriving by sea to Malta largely hailed from Bangladesh 53 Syria 26 Egypt 8 and Lebanon 7 their average age was 26 and 83 were male The report also highlights that the Maltese authorities effectively continue to criminalise asylum seekers arriving by air through its prosecution of those who use false documentation As it stands Maltese law on false documents does not make any exceptions for refugees – in law and in practice – despite the circumstances that may constrain them to pursue such a path The court’s decisions in such cases are described as “largely unpredictable” – offenders may be jailed for up to 2 years but suspended sentences are known to be handed out by the courts The policy appears to be a significant contributor to overcrowding at the Corradino Correctional Facility around 250 people were serving a sentence for passportrelated offences in 2021 representing a quarter to a third of the prison population As the report notes NGOs have expressed concerns that the criminalisation goes against the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention and penalises persons who seek not to risk their live at sea It also highlights that unless assisted by a lawyer or NGO it is highly unlikely that the individuals concerned would have the chance to apply for international protection before the end of their sentence
Families on social benefits cannot lead a dignified life – NAO,"May 2, 2023 7:49 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Families dependent on noncontributory social benefits are not being provided with sufficient income to lead a dignified life a National Audit Office NAO report found The study set the minimum annual budget for a two adult and two children family at €15185 and an augmented minimum annual budget for a decent living at €26389 a year However such a family on social benefits has a total disposable income of just €12478 The performance audit was carried out to determine whether noncontributory social benefits NCSB are achieving their intended purpose and whether their award is being adequately regulated and monitored The benefits are intended to assist individuals who for one reason or another are considered as vulnerable and are not engaged in employment and therefore resort to this safety net to secure an income But in its report the NAO said that “financially vulnerable fourmember households who have no choice but to depend on this safety net are not being provided with sufficient income to sustain a minimum budget by which they could secure a minimum decent standard of living” Such situations the NAO said show that the main objective of NCSBs is not being fully achieved “It is therefore paramount that this situation is reviewed and addressed accordingly so  that the more vulnerable segments of society are duly safeguarded and provided with what is considered a minimum income for them to lead a dignified life” The NAO said the NCSB system is a delicate balancing act between ensuring that deserving individuals are provided with sufficient income to secure a minimum decent standard of living while ascertaining that the availability of these benefits is not extended to individuals who can either engage in gainful employment or who are in possession of significant wealth While acknowledging government’s claim that beneficiaries have been on the decrease over the years NAO said “the current eligibility thresholds and criteria both those cited in local law and those decided on by the Department for Social Security are in need of a review as presently these are set at a level at which individuals with considerable wealth are being allowed to tap into NCSBs” Such a situation is surely counterproductive the the report said “especially when one considers that income provided through social benefits to fourmember households who really need them do not sufficiently cover their daily expenses to enjoy a minimum standard of living” While the NAO acknowledged the need for a temporary safety net for anybody who falls on hard times it contended the longterm nature of such benefits to individuals who possess high value assets “This office contends that savings that result from the tightening of eligibility criteria could make up for the increased levels of social benefits in instances in which intended beneficiaries can truly be considered as vulnerable” the NAO added An improved NCSB system would require an improved inspectorate to monitor for any irregularities and enforce this field accordingly the NAO said as it pointed out that this require the Benefits and Compliance Unit to expand its operations considerably In addition the NAO recommended that more rigorous inspections need to be carried out especially in the case of allegations or suspicion that NCSB beneficiaries would be engaging in employment “In so doing BCU would strengthen its image as an enforcer which would in turn serve as a deterrent for the occurrence of benefit fraud” the NAO said The report can be downloaded here

Keith Schembri cannot be questioned by MPs before court decision,"May 2, 2023 6:01 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Speaker Anġlu Farrugia ruled that the parliamentary public accounts committee cannot question former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri before the Constitutional Court delivers its judgment On Thursday Farrugia ruled that the PAC had to avoid the possibility of being found in breach of Schembri’s fair hearing rights In the ruling requested by PAC chair Darren Carabott the Speaker cited parliament’s rulebook known as the Erskine May which stipulates that a select committee hearing was subordinate to a court in matters of law This comes in the wake of a case Schembri initiated in which he claims Opposition MPs breached his right to fair hearing during recent committee meetings during which he testified on the Electrogas scandal In Constitutional proceedings filed by Schembri’s lawyers last week the former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s righthand man argued that his right to a fair hearing had been breached when Opposition MP rejected his request to suspend his testimony until a criminal investigation is concluded During a previous PAC meeting Schembri claimed that former finance minister turned Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and former deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta lied under oath leading to the Opposition members sitting on the committee demanding police commissioner Angelo Gafà to pursue criminal proceedings Schembri’s claims concerned the statements Scicluna – now governor of the Central Bank of Malta – and Valletta had made to the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia which found the state had to shoulder responsibility for her death However during last week’s meeting PAC chair Darren Carabott informed Schembri that only MPs can demand a ruling by the Speaker After MPs sitting on the committee including Labour members did not move such a request themselves Schembri’s lawyer Edward Gatt informed the MPs that his client would not be answering any further questions as he would be seeking a judgement over the matter by the Constitutional Court In the Constitutional application filed by Gatt and Mark Vassallo Schembri argued that the three Opposition MPs on the committee – Carabott David Agius Graham Bencini – should have recused themselves from deciding whether his request for a ruling should be accepted Describing this as a “manifest conflict of interest” the lawyers said that this breached the principle of not judging a case when they had an interest in its outcome The Opposition MPs Schembri’s lawyers argued had abandoned their positions as members of an impartial committee in favour of making themselves complainants against a person who was testifying before them by filing a premature criminal complaint before the testimony had even finished They also claimed that the incident had given rise to a “probably unprecedented” situation whereby a witness had been ordered to testify before the PAC in the Parliament building administered the oath by the President of the PAC replied to nearly four hours of questions put to him by three members of the same PAC who had requested – in their own name – a police investigation into the witness before he had finished testifying and above all a witness who had been asking for the protection of the Speaker of the House by asking the PAC President to refer his request for a suspension of testimony until the police investigations were complete

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Church wins back Balluta land on which developer proposed car park,"May 5, 2023 7:59 PM",The Church has won back a tract of land in Balluta on which a car park had been proposed This came after the First Hall of the Civil Court presided over by Mr Justice Grazio Mercieca upheld the plaintiff’s arguments after the Carmelite Order subleased the land in 2011 and which the court found to be in breach of the contract by which the land was donated in 1890 Delivering the judgement last month Mr Justice Mercieca ruled that the contract stipulated that the land on Tower Road in Sliema could only be used for religious reasons The case was filed by Archbishop Charles Scicluna against the Carmelite Order in 2015 after the developer John Cilia was granted a permit for an underground car park in the convent grounds In court it emerged that Fr Alexander Vella and Fr Charles Mallia had entered into a private agreement with Cilia in 2011 granting the convent grounds as a concession for 50 years for commercial purposes The land in question covers an area of almost 800 square metres and lies behind the Carmelite convent It is scheduled as a Grade 2 protected building and is also situated behind the Carmelite parish church dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel scheduled as Grade 1 Cilia first proposed a commercial development consisting of retail outlets and office development on the first floor as well as an underground car park with 84 spaces on the same site The controversial proposal was turned down by the Planning Authority A second application was filed on the same site proposing a multilevel car park for 115 vehicles It also included the relocation of the existing statue of the Virgin Mary in the garden as well as 11 olive trees and two palm trees The car park roof would be turned into a garden according to the plans However in court it emerged that the land was donated to the Carmelite Order in February 1890 on condition that it was not sold to third parties without the consent of the confraternity Veneranda Solidalità della Beata Vergine Del Carmelo della Vallettà The contract also places another condition that if the church and the land are no longer in use then they should revert back to the original owner The administrator of ecclesiastical entities appearing on behalf of the Archbishop argued that the private agreement entered into 2011 was in breach of the original donation contract The First Hall of the Civil Court observed that there was no doubt that Cilia was granted a concession and that he was allowed to transfer this title to third parties However the 1890 donation contract barred the recipients of the donated land to transfer it It also bound the recipients to use the land for religious reasons The concession was declared null and void since it was not done for spiritual reasons and was in breach of the donation contract Cilia was ordered to evict the land within a month

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Għargħur double murder trial: Jury concludes accused was insane,"May 4, 2023 6:12 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A jury has concluded that Kevin Micallef the man being accused of killing his mother and aunt in Għargħur in 2018 was not in his right mind when he committed the murder The verdict was given on Thursday evening with 8 out of 9 jury members deciding that he was in a state of insanity when he committed the murder Before the jury members deliberated on the facts of the case Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera reminded them that their decision should reflect the law and not their conscience She said that their decision ought to be based on several factors including that the process is based on evidence The trial by jury started on Tuesday with medical experts stating that Micallef suffered from the genetic disease Huntington’s disease which causes psychosis and that he was convinced that his mother Antonia Micallef and his aunt Maria Carmela Fenech were conspiring to kill him In July 2018 Micallef allegedly stabbed his relatives in the washroom before calling the emergency number 112 and confessing to the crime The accused is currently facing trial to determine whether he was insane when he committed the crime On Thursday the Court was asked to detain Micallef at Mount Carmel Hospital Defence lawyer Francois Dalli said that one needs to establish whether there is certainty and not probability when it comes to the claim of insanity He also reminded the jury that they were not to decide whether Micallef was guilty or not but whether at the time of the crime he was delusional or not He noted that it had emerged from various reports that the victim has Huntington’s disease and asked whether it was only the accused who has suffered from the effects of this degenerative disease He remarked that both his father and his brother died from this disease The defence lawyer added that the way the murder was carried out shows how Micallef was “not normal” because he would have otherwise left the house gone to a hotel or left the country after committing the murder He said that nothing Micallef did made sense because he did not even attempt to cover his tracks Furthermore he got angry with the Police because shortly after the murder he thought that they did not believe his confession that he had murdered his mother and aunt Dalli emphasised the fact that Court experts mentioned in their Court testimonies the accused’s paranoia and delusion The defence lawyer concluded that the accused was insane at the time of the crime and should not have to face a trial by jury He therefore asked for the accused to be detained at Mount Carmel

Decision on proposed Ġgantija apartment block postponed again,"May 4, 2023 2:52 PM",The Planning Authority has once again postponed taking a decision on the development of a fourstorey apartment block a few metres away from the UNESCO World Heritage Ġgantija temples in Gozo The applicant Mark Xerri plans to demolish existing structures to construct a reservoir with overlying maisonette with swimming pool two garages at ground floor level and six apartments at first second and third floor levels However the Planning Authority has postponed the decision to give Xerri more time to redesign the apartment block by reducing the height of each floor in a way that it is more in line with the existing streetscape characterised by two storey townhouses The site is within the Ġgantija Area of Archaeological Importance and within 30 metres of the Grade 1 Mithna Ta’ Kola The site is also within 260 metres of the Ġgantija world heritage site and the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage had initially warned that “any development that may eventually be approved at this location is not to negatively impact the perception of the scheduled windmill or Ġgantija” In a statement the authority said the Planning Board requested the applicant to further reduce its overall height “Although the proposed building is well below the maximum height limitation for the area and is not going to have a significant impact on the windmill the Board vigilantly also requested the applicant to recede the upper floor to neutralise the creation of blank party walls Additionally to this the applicant was requested to slightly amend the design of the façade to make it more homogenous with the existing streetscape and properties in the surrounding piazza area” the authority said However just months later the superintendence declared “the photomontages do not indicate that the proposed development will have a significant impact on the perception of the scheduled windmill” Objectors including Wirt Għawdex Flimkien GħallAmbjent Aħjar and Din lArt Ħelwa have strongly opposed the development saying it would ruin the streetscape and put the protected windmill at risk During the board meeting on Thursday the planning directorate gave a summary of a report they compiled about the outcome of nearby planning applications which concluded that the proposed development is not set to have a significant impact on the windmill Addressing Thursday’s hearing journalist Victor Borg said he was speaking on behalf of a coalition of NGOs as he raised several issues He said that both the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage and the directorate were building their arguments on “misleading” photomontages and streetscape elevations which he said do not conform to planning policies Claria Cutajar from Moviment Graffitti warned that approval will create a domino effect on other applications of the area
Żebbuġ mayor calls on government to turn Villa Buleben into public garden,"May 4, 2023 1:51 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti In light of government’s electoral pledge to create more green spaces the historic property Villa Buleben should be turned into a public garden Żebbuġ mayor Mark Camilleri said on Thursday In comments to Newsbookcommt following a demonstration by the Żebbuġ local council Camilleri said the property has the potential of becoming another San Anton gardens in reference to Malta’s largest public garden in Attard which attracts thousands of visitors Camilleri said that the council he is not satisfied with the new plans and that he cannot allow the destruction of this protected property This comes in the wake of plans to plans to transform Żebbuġ’s Villa Buleben – popularly known as “talBaruni” among locals – into a hotel However following a public outcry  the developers behind the project pledged to seek compromise that would make possible the sustainable restoration of the historic property But the revised plans submitted last month suggest that this compromise largely boils down to a little more greenery A comparison of the plans show that the proposed additional buildings on the palazzo’s grounds – an accommodation block and a cluster of 13 cabanastyle “independent additional units” – have not been reduced in number or size when compared to the previous proposal which Newsbookcommt had highlighted last July the total number of proposed guest rooms at 34 remains unchanged In fact the new plans would actually add a new structure for the loading and unloading of goods near to a back entrance Beyond that the most visible change has been the proposed planting of 41 additional trees – 20 bay laurels 11 holm oaks 5 olives and 5 date palms – largely around the new structures This would translate into a net gain of 20 trees since 21 trees would have to be removed to make way for the proposed additions The revised plans also make explicit the commitment to restore both Villa Buleben and the adjacent Chapel of the Our Lady of the Abandoned which is a part of the property including the chapel in the plans for the first time and also mapping the deterioration and proposed interventions on the palazzo But they appear to fail to address the key concerns of objectors including the Żebbuġ local council which had said last July that “the plans presented are still proposing extensive impacts within the scheduled building and its gardens also a green enclave” On Thursday the mayor also pointed out that the the Chapel of Our Lady of the Abandoned adjacent to the villa is a scheduled property adding that the the gardens and the villa should be granted the same level of planning protection He added that the Local Plan prohibits the development of residential buildings in open spaces and that if the villa is turned into a commercial establishment and become a venue for  weddings and parties it will impact the historic property and its surroundings For this reason Camilleri said the council is calling on government to purchase the entire property including the chapel in order to restore it and serve as a green lung in Żebbuġ “The villa should remain preserved as it is and this is an opportunity for a green lung in the heart of Žebbuġ” the mayor said adding that the area is bigger than San Anton He added that many elderly people have fond memories of this area and strongly believe that the area should also be enjoyed by future generations Video and images Miguela Xuereb

PM flouts parliament rules to react to hospitals report before anyone can read it,"May 15, 2023 6:46 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela was so keen to respond to the National Audit Office’s damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it properly that he chose to openly flout parliamentary procedure to do so Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on a report that appears to be an embarrassment to his government saw him bring it up in Parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon the government rejected its suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In the absence of an agreement Parliament continued with its scheduled debate on the financial estimates of the Environment and Resources Authority while the Nationalist Party scheduled an urgent press conference for 530pm at Parliament House But just as the PN’s press conference was about to begin – in timing that could hardly be considered coincidental – Abela chose to participate in the ERA debate to react to the report In doing so he was clearly out of order and in breach of parliamentary procedure as repeatedly highlighted by PN leader Bernard Grech and other MPs in points of order that they raised But while speaker Anġlu Farrugia accepted that Abela was in breach of procedure Malta’s longestserving speaker proved unable or unwilling to intervene His repeated appeals to Abela fell on deaf ears and Farrugia opted against taking further action While no journalist had been given the opportunity to read the 450page report properly before Abela launched his speech – the report was only made public around an hour earlier – the initial reports by Maltese newsrooms seized on the AuditorGeneral’s conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over a deal with Steward Health Care which obliged the government to pay the company €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled But Abela – who was legal adviser to his predecessor Joseph Muscat when this controversial agreement was reached – made no reference to this or any reference to Mizzi or Muscat at all Instead he focused on a limited defence on what took place when he became PM in 2020 and insisted that he was actually pleased with the findings of the report because for all the problems identified with the concession the report did not identify any misconduct on the part of his own government Consequently he argued he and his government were “serene” even if his insistence on reacting to a report before anyone could actually read it suggested an entirely different scenario Abela also referred to Grech’s decision last week to call on police commissioner Angelo Gafà to investigate him in connection with the hospitals deal insisting that the NAO report made clear that this gambit made no sense as it lacked any credibility As he did so he also drew comparison with a previous criminal complaint targeting his government that made by Repubblika in the wake of the death of a group of asylum seekers in Malta’s searchandrescue area and reports alleging the intentional sabotage of a rubber boat As he had then Abela complained that the PN – he had made no distinction between the party and the activist group three years ago and did not do so on Monday – wanted to send him to prison But in doing so the selfdescribed progressive political leader also reiterated antimigrant rhetoric that would generally be considered to be the preserve of farright politicians describing Malta’s actions in 2020 as a reaction to “increased infections” caused by asylum seekers There is no suggestion that asylum seekers – which are in any case detained at length on arrival through Malta’s controversial detention policy described as “arbitrary” by the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner  – had contributed to the spread of Covid19 or other infections at the time In fact Abela’s government at the time had even taken the unorthodox – and highly questionable from a human rights perspective – step of housing asylum seekers for weeks on end on pleasure boats that were patently unfit for this purpose Abela’s speech predictably derailed the discussion with the next PN MPs to speak taking his cue to disregard the agenda of the day to react to his comments Grech and former PN leader Adrian Delia both described Abela’s actions as an attempt to control the narrative on a scandal before anyone could reasonably read the report The PN leader dismissed the impression Abela sought to portray describing the NAO report as “yet another confirmation that the Labour governments of Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela are accomplices to the greatest fraud this country has ever witnessed” He insisted that Abela’s decision to speak at the same time the PN’s press conference was taken place was a new “abyss” for Abela which testified to the fact that he is “confused weak and compromised” words he has used to describe Abela in recent weeks Grech was also adamant that the air of serenity Abela was seeking to project was a façade and that the PM was clearly preoccupied by the latest developments “He promised continuity” Grech said in reference to remarks Abela nade when he succeeded Muscat as Labour leader and PM “And today we have yet another confirmation that he has delivered it”
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"No Comino beach concessions exist, minister maintains","May 4, 2023 8:00 AM",A parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Albert Buttigieg seeking information on the beach concessions in Comino was met with a surprising response by tourism minister Clayton Bartolo who claimed that there were no such concessions on the island at all The reply was particularly surprising since Buttigieg’s question took clear inspiration from comments Bartolo gave to journalists just over two weeks ago On 17 April the minister said that the existing concessions at Comino’s Blue Lagoon would be renewed without a tender since the government had yet to finalise a longterm plan for the site At the same time in the wake of a year characterised by popular outrage over the abusive behaviour of the beach concession operators Bartolo pledged that just a third of the area would be reserved to rental deckchairs Buttigieg thus asked Bartolo to table a copy of the documents through which beach concessions in Comino have been renewed and to specify the swimming spots which were covered by these concessions But Bartolo simply replied that “there is no concession in Comino” without elaborating further seemingly contradicting the remarks he made last month The reply and the context in which it was given leaves it unclear whether Bartolo’s reply was simply an exercise in semantics perhaps the existing concessions may be under another name or their renewal has not taken place yet Another possibility of course could be that the status quo has changed and the existing concessions have been cancelled One would however imagine that such a volteface – one which appears likely to be welcomed by the general public – would have been publicised by a government that has been rattled by various controversies over the past few months
Government in no rush to approve by-law limiting Coast Road caravans,"May 4, 2023 7:00 AM",The government is clearly in no rush to approve a bylaw proposed by the Naxxar local council that would ban the permanent parking of caravans and camper vans in its territory – which includes Baħar iċĊagħaq and the Coast Road – despite the bylaw being unanimously approved by the council nearly two years ago Local council bylaws have to be sent to the minister responsible for local government for publication in the Malta Government Gazette to enter into force and the Naxxar council had taken this step in May 2021 sending the bill to thenminister José Herrera Naxxar’s coastal territory has effectively seen a number of shanty towns emerge as a number of open spaces have been taken over yearround by caravans and camper vans Such a practice is illegal in many countries where caravans and camper vans are generally banned from staying in the same place for more than a fixed period with possible exceptions in place for specialised caravan sites Nationalist Party MP Albert Buttigieg asked a number of parliamentary questions on the caravans last week but the answers he received on Wednesday do not suggest that the matter is being treated with any urgency by the government A question on the Naxxar bylaw saw minister Owen Bonnici – who took over responsibility over local councils from Herrera – who simply said that “with reference to the subject raised in in this question talks and meetings with all stakeholders are ongoing with the aim of addressing the issue in the most appropriate manner” The council’s bylaw thus continues to be blocked while the government arguably buys time through vaguelydescribed discussions Tourism minister Clayton Bartolo similarly spoke of “various meetings including with the Naxxar local council” when asked about promises to address the seeminglypermanent presence of caravans along the Coast Road with the minister stopping short of detailing what steps the government was planning to pursue And Buttigieg’s question to health minister Chris Fearne on the lack of proper sewage facilities for what have become quasipermanent coastal homes also arguably failed to bring about a satisfactory reply Fearne simply referred the MP to Bonnici’s answer At present Malta lacks any specific regulations on camper vans and caravans effectively treating the former as trailers and the latter as cars which can thus be parked permanently as long as the relevant licences are obtained and paid for That such a situation can lend itself to abuse has long been recognised in many other countries and regulations prohibiting the permanent of caravans and camper vans are common France for instance prohibits the parking of caravans in a fixed site for more than three months in a calendar year in regulations introduced to address the situation Malta now faces the abusive parking of caravans along the coast Naxxar is also home to a designated caravan site the “Safari Camping Club” caravan village at Baħar iċĊagħaq adding insult to injury this too appears to be flouting the terms of its agreement with no enforcement in sight Under this agreement – signed in 2009 and tweaked slightly in 2013 – caravans can only stay on site for four months between 15 May and 15 September The agreement was reached after the government cleared widespread illegalities on site which saw the Safari Camping Club’s members turn their “camps” into a permanent village But ultimately the compromise foreseen by this agreement lasted little over a decade the caravans have now remained on site since the summer of 2020 taking the situation back to the abuses the agreement sought to put to an end The absence of enforcement – and the government’s reluctance to issue new regulations – appears to suggest that the government may be reluctant to take on caravan owners and risk losing their votes Such a reluctance to address the abusive behaviour of large groups concerning public land of course is not exactly unprecedented as a visit to Armier can easily confirm
Residents object to 11-storey elderly care home in Żebbuġ,"May 3, 2023 9:10 PM",Residents are objecting to the construction of a highrise old people’s home in a residential area in Triq ilMitħna and Triq Giovanni Pullicino in Żebbuġ saying this will “cause irreparable damage to the historical heritage the environment and the quality of life of the community” The proposed plans for the 11storey building includes 98 bedrooms three basement parking levels a therapy pool with ancillary facilities laundry facilities a chapel and multipurpose hall a retail area a hairdresser pharmacy and medical clinic The application also foresees excavation works for the construction of reservoirs and pump rooms The Żebbuġ residents objecting to the plans pointed out that the massive development is in breach of the current local plan which stipulates that residential institutions should be of “a small scale and do not create adverse impacts on the residential amenity of the area” They said that however the proposed residence for the elderly cannot be defined as small scale as it will consist of seven floors above ground and four underground floors The residents also pointed out that the proposed development will intensify the traffic in a quiet residential area “It will lead to a loss in quality of life since the volume of activity it will generate will result in noise and air pollution Local residential areas should be protected and refrained from being transformed into a commercial hub” they said Moreover the residents said that the proposed home for the elderly will reach a height of 24 metres which is 65m higher than the general maximum allowable height in an area that is predominantly formed by twostorey terraced houses The proposed development –  located along the limit of the development area and overlooking an outside development zone – “will be creating a negative visual impact on the surrounding residential area and become an eyesore from distant areas and views” they added In addition the residents said that the site lies within a bufferzone of a scheduled building a Knights’ period windmill – IlMitħna talGħodor located at Triq ilMitħna If the development goes ahead the residents said a 21 metre blank party wall will form the backdrop of the protected windmill “The proposal seeks to excavate the site more than 15 meters below street level It is of public knowledge that below the proposed development’s site there are Knight’s period reservoirs It is said that these reservoirs supply water to a number of UCA gardens in HazZebbug This local heritage should be protected and preserved” the residents said The public can submit objections by Friday 12 May 2023 by sending an email to representationspaorgmt quoting the application number – PA0207023 – in the subject line or by following this link

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Malta drops six places in press freedom index,"May 3, 2023 9:08 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Malta’s press freedom continued to deteriorate in the past year according to Reporters Without Borders’ annual World Press Freedom Index with the country slipping down six places when compared to 2022 Published on Wednesday RSF’s 2020 World Press Freedom Index places Malta in the 84th spot six places lower than in 2022 The purpose of the World Press Freedom Index is to compare the level of freedom enjoyed by journalists and media in 180 countries and territories RSF and its panel of experts define press freedom as “the ability of journalists as individuals and collectives to select produce and disseminate news in the public interest independent of political economic legal and social interference and in the absence of threats to their physical and mental safety Journalists in Malta have to cope with a highly polarised environment under the strong influence of political parties an analysis of the index noted Despite the public inquiry into the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was concluded in 2021 the index notes that the government was reluctant to implement the recommendations listed in the inquiry report The inquiry had concluded that the state must shoulder responsibility for the assassination because it created an atmosphere of impunity Almost six years from the assassination of Caruana Galizia full justice is yet to be served the report notes In 2022 Alfred and George Degiorgio pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 40 years in prison Earlier their accomplice Vince Muscat pleaded guilty following a plea deal and was also jailed for 15 years However the masterminds and others involved in the crime have yet to be convicted It was observed that the ruling party – the Labour Party – wields a strong influence over the public broadcaster It also makes use of public advertising to exert pressure on private media “Many politicians select specific journalists for exclusive interviews while those considered “hostile” are ignored including within the party media The government requires an “access card” issued to journalists to cover government events or attend press conferences” the country report reads As for Malta’s legal framework while press freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution the country’s legal and regulatory framework does not allow journalists to exercise their rights It was observed that the independent media are discriminated against in accessing information with the local authorities have gone so far as to challenge in court each of the 40 requests for access to information sent by a media outlet effectively targeting it with a new type of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation SLAPP Journalists are regularly the targets of SLAPP and family members of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia killed in 2017 are even targeted with posthumous defamation lawsuits It was also noted that while it is relatively easy to launch a media outlet the small market offers limited sources of funding for independent media whose sustainability is undermined by nontransparent and discriminatory distribution of public funds The report notes that the subsidies offered during the coronavirus pandemic were mostly granted to political parties’ media outlets On almost every issue of public interest Maltese society suffers from deep polarization “Reporting on certain topics such as migration or abortion remains unpopular and incites abuse towards journalists covering these topics Very few journalists from minority groups work for the mainstream media Investigative reporting is carried out by a handful of journalists almost exclusively men” In a statement to mark the occasion of World Press Freedom Day the Institute of Maltese Journalists IĠM called on government to tangibly create an environment where journalists and media actors can continue carrying out their duty to serve democracy The institute noted recent statements by prime minister Robert Abela that the media is the fourth pillar of democracy as acknowledged in the Labour Party’s electoral manifesto IĠM said it expects the government to put its money where its mouth is and really with facts recognise it as such “In the light of such statements it is indeed baffling how the government continues to push back on a recommendation by its own committee of experts to entrench the media in the enforceable parts of the country’s constitution” The institute also called on government to address other issues that are seriously undermining the media in Malta primary among them is the Freedom of Information Act which it said is weak abused by the public authorities and in dire need of a total overhaul Along with this is a shift in mentality whereby information is given rather than kept under wraps “Other issues include the considerable financial difficulties being faced by media outlets The IĠM is looking at models used abroad and will be making its recommendations to government in this regard” “The IĠM is evolving into the firstever journalists’ trade union in Malta giving it and its members a strong legal standing It is in these trying times that journalists must stand united It is together along with civil society and democracy campaigners that changes however small they are can be achieved It is many of these small steps which will continue to transform the Maltese media landscape which in turn will result in stronger journalism and a stronger democracy”
"Malta failed to rescue nearly 7,500 people in distress last year – report","May 3, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Malta’s apparent policy of largely ignoring distress calls by potential asylum seekers have seen it fail to rescue no less than 7459 people in distress last year according to statistics compiled for the European Council of Refugees and Exiles ECRE During the same period the country was also accused of being involved in 14 pushbacks – which fall foul of international law – involving a total of 789 people according to the 2022 country report on Malta prepared as part of the Asylum Information Database AIDA The report was compiled by aditus one of two Maltese members of the ECRE alliance which brings together 110 NGOs from 40 European countries the other is the Jesuit Refugee Service Malta Claims that Malta was failing to respond to distress calls in the area it is responsible for have long been made by NGOs active in rescues including Alarm Phone which operates an independent hotline that has effectively a key contact point for people attempting the central Mediterranean route in their bid to reach safety in Europe Earlier this year criticism of Malta’s apparent policy has been taken up by members of the Italian government with the parliamentary leader of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni’s party accusing Malta of “pretending not to see” people in its SAR area a charge which Malta has denied The AIDA report compiled all instances in which Malta appears to have failed to intervene last year finding that most cases in which Malta did not intervene took place between October and December Malta is estimated to have ignored distress calls concerning no less than 4400 people during those three months And while many appear to have reached Italy – or be rescued by Italian authorities – and hundreds of others were allegedly pushed back with Malta’s assistance hundreds of people remain unaccounted for in the seas Malta is responsible for In comparison the UN’s refugee agency the UNHCR recorded 444 sea arrivals in Malta including 409 who were disembarked by the Armed Forces of Malta after rescue at sea 12 persons were airlifted by the AFM while at least 23 arrived spontaneously The people arriving by sea to Malta largely hailed from Bangladesh 53 Syria 26 Egypt 8 and Lebanon 7 their average age was 26 and 83 were male The report also highlights that the Maltese authorities effectively continue to criminalise asylum seekers arriving by air through its prosecution of those who use false documentation As it stands Maltese law on false documents does not make any exceptions for refugees – in law and in practice – despite the circumstances that may constrain them to pursue such a path The court’s decisions in such cases are described as “largely unpredictable” – offenders may be jailed for up to 2 years but suspended sentences are known to be handed out by the courts The policy appears to be a significant contributor to overcrowding at the Corradino Correctional Facility around 250 people were serving a sentence for passportrelated offences in 2021 representing a quarter to a third of the prison population As the report notes NGOs have expressed concerns that the criminalisation goes against the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention and penalises persons who seek not to risk their live at sea It also highlights that unless assisted by a lawyer or NGO it is highly unlikely that the individuals concerned would have the chance to apply for international protection before the end of their sentence
Families on social benefits cannot lead a dignified life – NAO,"May 2, 2023 7:49 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Families dependent on noncontributory social benefits are not being provided with sufficient income to lead a dignified life a National Audit Office NAO report found The study set the minimum annual budget for a two adult and two children family at €15185 and an augmented minimum annual budget for a decent living at €26389 a year However such a family on social benefits has a total disposable income of just €12478 The performance audit was carried out to determine whether noncontributory social benefits NCSB are achieving their intended purpose and whether their award is being adequately regulated and monitored The benefits are intended to assist individuals who for one reason or another are considered as vulnerable and are not engaged in employment and therefore resort to this safety net to secure an income But in its report the NAO said that “financially vulnerable fourmember households who have no choice but to depend on this safety net are not being provided with sufficient income to sustain a minimum budget by which they could secure a minimum decent standard of living” Such situations the NAO said show that the main objective of NCSBs is not being fully achieved “It is therefore paramount that this situation is reviewed and addressed accordingly so  that the more vulnerable segments of society are duly safeguarded and provided with what is considered a minimum income for them to lead a dignified life” The NAO said the NCSB system is a delicate balancing act between ensuring that deserving individuals are provided with sufficient income to secure a minimum decent standard of living while ascertaining that the availability of these benefits is not extended to individuals who can either engage in gainful employment or who are in possession of significant wealth While acknowledging government’s claim that beneficiaries have been on the decrease over the years NAO said “the current eligibility thresholds and criteria both those cited in local law and those decided on by the Department for Social Security are in need of a review as presently these are set at a level at which individuals with considerable wealth are being allowed to tap into NCSBs” Such a situation is surely counterproductive the the report said “especially when one considers that income provided through social benefits to fourmember households who really need them do not sufficiently cover their daily expenses to enjoy a minimum standard of living” While the NAO acknowledged the need for a temporary safety net for anybody who falls on hard times it contended the longterm nature of such benefits to individuals who possess high value assets “This office contends that savings that result from the tightening of eligibility criteria could make up for the increased levels of social benefits in instances in which intended beneficiaries can truly be considered as vulnerable” the NAO added An improved NCSB system would require an improved inspectorate to monitor for any irregularities and enforce this field accordingly the NAO said as it pointed out that this require the Benefits and Compliance Unit to expand its operations considerably In addition the NAO recommended that more rigorous inspections need to be carried out especially in the case of allegations or suspicion that NCSB beneficiaries would be engaging in employment “In so doing BCU would strengthen its image as an enforcer which would in turn serve as a deterrent for the occurrence of benefit fraud” the NAO said The report can be downloaded here

Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration

Occupy Justice demands reopening of Egrant inquiry,"May 17, 2023 9:39 AM",Activists from Occupy Justice staged a protest outside Castille on Tuesday evening calling for the Egrant inquiry to be reopened “The reopening of the Egrant Inquiry is long overdue You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves for ignoring this History will not be kind to you for betraying those you were duty bound to serve and protect  Take action or resign” the activists warned Robert Abela’s administration In September 2021 Magistrate Ian Farrugia called for the reopening of Egrant inquiry  However to date the Attorney General has failed to take any action In spite of recent revelations regarding the Egrant Inquiry and all the dirty manoeuvres by Pilatus Bank officials and employees Occupy Justice said “there hasn’t been so much as a peep of action from the Floriana Police Depot or the Attorney General’s office” The magisterial inquiry into Pilatus Bank ordered that the Egrant inquiry be reopened after finding reasonable suspicion that 11 million were transferred from Azerbaijan to an account at Pilatus Bank through a parallel and secretive accounting system Murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had claimed that Egrant was owned by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s wife Michelle and the company received a payment of US1017 from Leyla Aliyeva daughter of Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev The Muscats vehemently deny these allegations An inquiry ordered by Muscat had found no evidence linking him and his wife to the secret Panama company but the owner remains unknown to this day “Whilst they’re dragging their feet and coming up with excuses to justify their inaction making sure that justice is delayed criminals roam free and are gifted years of a headstart to cover their tracks It seems that our institutions are spinelessly hell bent in protecting fraudsters and corrupt individuals instead of investigating them” Occupy Justice said Reminding finance minister Clyde Caruana that on 1 November 2019 he pledged to make available all necessary resources should there be ‘a request’ to reopen the Egrant Inquiry Occupy Justice said “that request was made by Magistrate Ian Farrugia who called for it to be reopened The Attorney General was legally obliged to comply with Magistrate Farrugia’s order Instead this was ignored – not that we’ve come to expect better from this office” “Well here we are making the request again We’re also demanding that this time round the terms for the Inquiry are not drafted by the prime suspect in the case It is laughable that this happened in the first place” They added that the contempt with which the Labour administration has treated the Maltese people for these past ten years is unprecedented “using its privilege and power to shield those who should have faced justice years ago All this makes us wonder as to who is really pulling the strings”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not

Keith Schembri cannot be questioned by MPs before court decision,"May 2, 2023 6:01 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Speaker Anġlu Farrugia ruled that the parliamentary public accounts committee cannot question former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri before the Constitutional Court delivers its judgment On Thursday Farrugia ruled that the PAC had to avoid the possibility of being found in breach of Schembri’s fair hearing rights In the ruling requested by PAC chair Darren Carabott the Speaker cited parliament’s rulebook known as the Erskine May which stipulates that a select committee hearing was subordinate to a court in matters of law This comes in the wake of a case Schembri initiated in which he claims Opposition MPs breached his right to fair hearing during recent committee meetings during which he testified on the Electrogas scandal In Constitutional proceedings filed by Schembri’s lawyers last week the former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s righthand man argued that his right to a fair hearing had been breached when Opposition MP rejected his request to suspend his testimony until a criminal investigation is concluded During a previous PAC meeting Schembri claimed that former finance minister turned Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and former deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta lied under oath leading to the Opposition members sitting on the committee demanding police commissioner Angelo Gafà to pursue criminal proceedings Schembri’s claims concerned the statements Scicluna – now governor of the Central Bank of Malta – and Valletta had made to the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia which found the state had to shoulder responsibility for her death However during last week’s meeting PAC chair Darren Carabott informed Schembri that only MPs can demand a ruling by the Speaker After MPs sitting on the committee including Labour members did not move such a request themselves Schembri’s lawyer Edward Gatt informed the MPs that his client would not be answering any further questions as he would be seeking a judgement over the matter by the Constitutional Court In the Constitutional application filed by Gatt and Mark Vassallo Schembri argued that the three Opposition MPs on the committee – Carabott David Agius Graham Bencini – should have recused themselves from deciding whether his request for a ruling should be accepted Describing this as a “manifest conflict of interest” the lawyers said that this breached the principle of not judging a case when they had an interest in its outcome The Opposition MPs Schembri’s lawyers argued had abandoned their positions as members of an impartial committee in favour of making themselves complainants against a person who was testifying before them by filing a premature criminal complaint before the testimony had even finished They also claimed that the incident had given rise to a “probably unprecedented” situation whereby a witness had been ordered to testify before the PAC in the Parliament building administered the oath by the President of the PAC replied to nearly four hours of questions put to him by three members of the same PAC who had requested – in their own name – a police investigation into the witness before he had finished testifying and above all a witness who had been asking for the protection of the Speaker of the House by asking the PAC President to refer his request for a suspension of testimony until the police investigations were complete

Standards commissioner asked to look into Ira Losco’s Project Green FB posts,"May 2, 2023 12:20 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Academic and independent political candidate Arnold Cassola has asked standards commissioner Joe Azzopardi to investigate after singer Ira Losco received public funds to use her social media accounts to promote Project Green – in a manner that may be seen to promote its CEO Steve Ellul and minister Miriam Dalli The story had been publicised by The Shift with Losco confirming that she had been contracted by Project Green to promote the public spaces overseen by the agency But it was her decision to link the personal pages of Ellul and Dalli in her posts that was flagged as particularly problematic by the news portal and Cassola with the former highlighting how Azzopardi’s predecessor George Hyzler had made clear that politicians cannot use public funds for selfpromotion In this spirit Cassola – whose letters have initiated the lion’s share of investigations by the Office of the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life to date – has asked Azzopardi to look into the matter citing three key concerns in his letter to the office Cassola argued that Losco’s post constituted false advertising since it was “political promotion by stealth” and that Dalli and Ellul – who is believed to be planning to contest next year’s European Parliament elections – were using taxpayer funds to promote their personal political interests But he also pointed out that the singer’s posts also involved the improper use of young children in political advertising since a number of the posts also featured photographs of her children

‘Jumbo’ BCRS machines allow deposit of all plastic bottles at once,"May 2, 2023 10:38 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti BCRS Malta has started installing new ‘jumbo’ machines that appear to address two concerns that have attracted countless complaints since the container refund scheme it manages opened operations a processing time that is far too slow and machines that reach capacity far too easily These new jumbo machines can store up to 9000 containers and make possible the depositing of plastic bottles all at once – instead of the timeconsuming deposit of every item individually But the machines do come with a drawback as they only handle PET plastic containers they do not handle the glass bottles and cans that are also included in the container refund scheme Consequently slower singlefeed machines will be set up alongside these bulk PET machines to cater for any other goods that people may need to bring The company aims to install 10 such machines putting the price tag of this initiative at €25 million The first two machines – at Luxol’s ParkandRide and at the BCRS clearing centre in Ħal Far – have now gone live BCRS Malta said that the jumbo machines are being manned by specialised personnel to help guide the individuals making use of them and that they will be operational every day between 6am and 10pm – the singlefeed machines alongside them operate on a 247 basis While their processing time is roughly the same as that of the smaller machines the jumbo machines do most of the work expected of the smaller machines’ users The company said that more than 60 million beverage containers had been returned in the first five months of the scheme’s operation with 2581 tonnes of plastic glass and metal exported for recycling purposes It reminded that its reverse vending machines only accepted the beverage containers explicitly included in the scheme namely water still sparkling and flavoured soft drinks energy drinks beers ciders dilutables flavoured drinks with less than 5 alcohol and readytodrink coffee They do not accept containers for juices dairy products wines alcoholic spirits cartons and pouches which continue to be collected through previouslyexisting waste collection schemes
Opposition proposes food waste law,"May 15, 2023 4:30 PM",The Opposition presented a private members’ bill aimed at fighting food waste and loss on Monday morning The proposed law comes as Malta is the only EU country that does not have a national plan on food waste Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo said the bill is intended to reduce food waste at every stage from its production to processing distribution and handling Noting that over 20 of the population was at risk of poverty and social exclusion the MP said official figures show that each person generates some 135 kilograms of food waste every year In order to address the situation Bartolo said Malta needs to take immediate action to ensure that food – an essential resource for a healthy society and sustainable living – is distributed with the least possible waste adding that no citizen should be deprived of this basic right because of their social or financial situation The Opposition’s proposed law provides that the Malta Food Agency shall seek to reduce food waste at every stage of production processing distribution and handling by “a encouraging the recovery and donation of excess food for the purpose of social solidarity among humans “b by curbing the negative impacts on the environment and the natural resources by carrying out actions that reduce food wastage and the generation of waste from food “c by promoting the reuse and recycling of food with the aim of lengthening sic the life cycle of food and “d by promoting research and the knowledge of information among consumers on all matters that are necessary to reduce food wastage and the generation of waste from food” Nationalist parliamentary group whip Robert Cutajar MP Toni Bezzina accompanied Bartolo as he presented the private members’ bill to Speaker Anġlu Farrugia Prime Minister Robert Abela’s has come under fire from antipoverty campaigners for refusing to “impose” legislation on supermarkets Last year antipoverty campaigner Matthew Borg had told the Andrew Azzopardi talkshow on 103 Malta’s Heart that “guaranteeing access to food to everyone should not depend on charity… but it should be written in law” A 2017 European Commission report entitled ‘Redistribution of Surplus Food’ exposed Malta’s failure to tackle the issue and was the only country to have no plan Borg had said
Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Construction licensing regulations ‘fall short’ – Graffitti,"May 2, 2023 8:44 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The proposed construction licensing regulations “could have been a sorelyneeded turning point in the regulation of the construction industry but they fall short of their stated aims” according to Moviment Graffitti The NGO made this statement in its submission to a public consultation issued by the Building  Construction Authority along with a number of proposals which it argues would strengthen the regulations and ensure that they could truly bring about a safer and more regulated construction industry “The licensing of contractors is long overdue Only a few months ago Jean Paul Sofia like Miriam Pace three years ago was killed in a construction incident The workplace death of construction workers has also become a monthly occurrence and thousands are injured on construction sites every year These deaths were preventable had there been serious regulation of the construction industry” Graffitti said “The regulations presented not only come tragically late but are also far too timid in their approach Our communities deserve better” Graffitti said that its key concerns included the lack of clarity and transparency on the manner in which breaches of the regulations – and of licence conditions – would be handled by the BCA as things stand the regulations give the public little or no power to participate in proceedings or even be informed about them It also took aim at the “soft approach to enforcement and penalisation” deeming it not sufficient to address the construction industry’s present freeforall attitudes “The public and our quality of life should be at the heart of this reform” Graffitti said “This is why transparency and the right to be informed are crucial and worryingly missing from the regulations” The NGO was critical of the government’s apparent inability to create a structure free from political involvement the licensing committee as proposed is to be appointed by the minister with “conveniently wide” eligibility criteria and factually perpetual terms of reappointment It also called for the immediate publication of National Building and Construction Codes together with tangible enforcement of existing laws to eliminate the unsafe and illegal practices plaguing the industry in line with its publication Reforming Planning and Construction in Malta which outlined 134 proposals aimed at reforming the planning and construction sector “Government is once again being weak with the strong to the detriment of our safety and quality of life” Graffitti concluded
UN: Libya is not a safe port of disembarkation,"May 2, 2023 8:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Libya is not a safe port of disembarkation the United Nations secretarygeneral António Guterres said in the latest report on the UN’s Support Mission in Libya published in April However despite repeated warnings and an ongoing case at the International Criminal Court Malta continues to defy this by coordinating pushbacks of asylum seekers at sea to ensure that they are intercepted and returned to Libya Despite the Labour government’s rhetoric that Malta does not have the capacity to receive asylum seekers on its shores so far this year only 92 people – including an unaccompanied child – were brought to Malta after being rescued at sea Most of the asylum seekers brought to Malta – 60 – were brought to Malta last month which took place amid increasing criticism from Italy on Malta’s apparent failure to assist people in distress within its searchandrescue area – criticism which echoes assertions long made by civil society While noting that violations against refugees and migrants in Libya continue unabated including in detention centres Guterres reiterated that Libya is not a safe country for asylum seekers “Any refugees and migrants intercepted along the central Mediterranean route should be assigned a safe port of disembarkation in accordance with the law of the sea international maritime law international human rights law and refugee law” the UN secretarygeneral said Guterres also called for rightsbased alternatives to detention including by establishing legal and policy frameworks to manage migration in line with international law This confirms that the repatriation and push backs of asylum seekers at sea coordinated by Malta and other EU countries in conjunction with the socalled Libyan coastguard defy international law Although Malta and Italy deny this UN refugee agency officials and human rights organisations have long denounced the conditions of detention centers for migrants in Libya citing practices of beatings rape and other forms of torture and insufficient food Migrants endure weeks and months of those conditions awaiting passage in unseaworthy rubber dinghies or rickety fishing boats arranged by human traffickers Malta’s prime minister Robert Abela and his predecessor Joseph Muscat have been reported to the International Criminal Court ICC which was asked to investigate their involvement in “crimes against humanity against migrants and refugees who have been intercepted at sea and systematically returned to and detained in Libya” This came as last year a group of international organisations accused Libyan militias of committing war crimes against migrants in detention centres and included Malta and Italy in their complaint for their support to Tripoli’s coastguard In a case initiated at the International Criminal Court ICC Malta and Italy were accused of acting in a coordinated manner with the Libyan coastguard in the recovery of migrants to ensure that they were intercepted and returned to Libya The European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights ECCHR said that despite knowledge of these crimes EU officials together with political leaders in Italy and Malta have strengthened their collaboration with Libya to prevent refugees and migrants from fleeing Libya by sea Moreover Pope Francis often highlights the conditions of what he describes as “concentration camps while urging European countries not to pushback asylum seekers to Libya and other unsafe countries where they suffer “inhumane violence” On arrival in the North African country many asylum seekers are often kidnapped and kept captive by militias or other armed groups or used by traffickers and smugglers as currency for months on end while awaiting passage in unseaworthy rubber dinghies or rickety fishing boats arranged by human traffickers Several international reports as well as thousands of accounts by survivors have documented the heinous treatment meted out to migrants and refugees in Libya In November 2021 the UN factfinding mission in Libya found these violations to be crimes against humanity In February 2017 the Italian government signed an EUsponsored agreement with the Libyan government which was renewed for a further three years last year Under this agreement Italy and the EU have been helping the Libyan Coastguard – often accused of cooperating with smugglers while pushing back migrants at sea with the cooperation of Malta and Italy – to enhance their maritime surveillance capacity Since 2017 Italy has set aside €326 million for international missions to support the Libyan Coastguard with €105 million allocated in 2021 NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres recently said that “this help comes at the expense of migrants and refugees’ human rights as virtually everyone intercepted at sea by the Libyan Coastguard ends up in a Libyan detention centre The agreement between Italy and Libya supports the system of exploitation extortion and abuse in which so many migrants find themselves trapped” A Council of Europe CoE report published in March 2021 said that Libya is not a place of safety for disembarkation owing to the serious human rights violations committed against refugees and migrants and the ongoing conflict in the country
‘From nothing to Dar Arka’: Fr Manwel’s indispensable work in aid of people with disability in Gozo,"May 2, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Parents of children with disability would often ask why they found no assistance or facilities in Gozo when Fr Manwel Curmi fondly known as Dun Mawuel talArka became a priest some 62 years ago Since then Fr Manwel has made it his life mission to change the situation and among others he was instrumental in opening the first residence for people with disability in Gozo Dar Arka The centre apart from offering residential services on a permanent and respite basis also offers a wide range of services to people with special needs and their families Speaking on Għawdex Jitkellem on 103 Malta’s Heart Fr Manwel explained how the idea to build a residence for people with disabilities today known as Dar Arka was born and how the Bishop agreed that such a residence was needed but told the priest that he would have to find the money for it himself However Fr Manwel is not one to give up easily and he turned to Maltese and Gozitan immigrants living in Australia England the US and Canada to collect donations for the residence – the first of its kind in Gozo He said that the residence was mainly funded through his visits to Maltese and Gozitan immigrants to who he would explain his plans to help people with disability and their families Eventually this led to the creation of the Arka Foundation – a voluntary nongovernmental organisation that promotes the welfare of people with special needs Presently the foundation runs three residential facilities – Dar Arka Dar ilĠublew talĦniena and Dar ilMadonna ta’ Pinu which includes apartments where people with disability can lead an independent life When he first became a priest more than 60 years ago Fr Manwel felt the need to create a space for people with disabilities who at the time were often kept hidden because of the stigma that existed Together with volunteers he started organising trips for them including visits to village feasts where they would hear Mass and have a little party When he first set his plans in motion only some five people would attend but the numbers soon increased and this motivated him even further to find the necessary funds the equivalent of €700000 to build the respite centre 23 years ago He also spoke about how society’s perception about people with disabilities has changed over the decades and how they are nowadays integrated in society The veteran priest is not one to blow his trumpets and said that this was only made possible thanks to God’s help and the people’s generosity Fr Manwel said that “it wasn’t my hard work but the Lord worked through me” Calling on people to continue helping Dar Arka where some 40 people are employed Fr Manwel explained that 25 years after Dar Arka opened its doors the residence’s first floor needs to be modernised The project he said will allow more residents to be welcomed as he explained that the works include new tiling plumbing and electricity Moreover he said the works will ensure that the residence is of a standard expected by authorities You can help the Arka Foundation by sending a donation to IBAN number MT31VALL22013000000040017808653 or call on 21565773 or 21550596
"Grech: PN is people’s party, Labour hijacked by criminals","May 1, 2023 7:34 PM",Bernard Grech said the Nationalist Party is the only “people’s party” and he called for a coalition against a Labour Party which has been hijacked by criminals and greedy people Speaking in Guardamangia outside PBS and St Luke’s hospital at a protest marking May Day the PN leader doubled down on his claim that orders to arrest a young person for hanging a banner calling for justice for Jean Paul Sofia opposite Parliament came from the police depot Accusing police chief Angelo Gafà of giving the order to arrest the young man Grech said “we know that the order for this young person’s arrest for hanging a banner came from the police depot” In reference to the commissioner’s rare press statement denying the claim Grech said “so when you don’t speak out against a claim does that mean it’s true Is this what it all means” He added that greedy people and criminals have hijacked the Labour Party the police commissar is “asleep” and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg “has her hands tied” Grech said the PN is the only party to stand up for workers as he reminded the crowd that from the Opposition benches the PN uncovered the fraudulent hospitals deal The Nationalist Party’s protest organised under the slogan ‘Nagħtu sSaħħa lillĦaddiem’ Power to Workers touched on a number of issues including the hospitals deal annulled by court government’s control over the public broadcaster and governments refusal to order a public inquiry into the death of construction victim Jean Paul Sofia Grech said that the Labour government sold three public hospitals to foreign thieves “opening the door wide open to them and showing them exactly how they can steal from us” He added that disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat together with former chief of staff Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi knew that the Vitals investors were thieves “No wonder they Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi opened trusts in New Zealand and companies in Panama Anyone who dared open their mouth was called a traitor” Prime Minister Robert Abela the PN leader added at the time served as legal counsel to Cabinet and gave his blessing so that the three hospitals can be resold to Steward Healthcare instead of being returned to government after Vitals exited the concession “They did everything to try and make people forget about this And he did this with the complicity of PBS which everyday tries to bury the Nationalist Party’s news and tries to paint a positive picture of everything” Grech said Grech also lashed out at the prime minister’s earlier announcement that the annual tax refund cheque would be sent out in the coming days insisting that “we are now used to this ploy” He told prime minister Robert Abela that he should instead refund the people the taxpayer money stolen by Labour governments since 2013 including the millions that Abela himself pigged out on over the past 10 years Grech said the government had already recouped the cheque refund money by taxing people on their annual costofliving increase and said that instead of such gimmicks government should ensure that all workers are given the dignity they deserve
"Abela announces fresh tax refund cheques, pledges planning reform","May 1, 2023 6:03 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Robert Abela announced that people will start receiving their tax refund cheques as of next week as the Labour Party organised its annual May Day activity in Valletta During the meeting which was moved from the larger Castille Square to the street just outside parliament in Malta’s capital the Prime Minister said that his government has only just completed the first year from its fiveyear mandate stressing that more is to come in the coming years On the tax refunds while taking a dig at the Nationalist Party for its opposition to the scheme Abela said this will cost government €26 million as he reminded that since 2017 the Labour government has forked out more than €100 million in such refunds The major announcements Abela made the tax refund cheques affordable housing and hinting at planning process reforms come in the wake of recent polls in which Labour no longer enjoys an unassailable lead and clashes with a number of Labour mayors over the party’s socialist credentials the environment and overdevelopment While hailing workers for their contribution to the “economic miracle” Abela said 2023 was the time to make the environment a priority However while hinting at reforms in the planning process and reiterating government’s plans to regularise the construction industry Abela failed to list any tangible initiatives to protect workers or make any direct mention of the victims of the construction industry Instead he hinted at reforms in the planning process that will prevent construction to start if the permit is still being contested in court or in front of the Planning Authority Abela who previously was engaged on handsome retainer as the Planning Authority’s lawyer asked “does it make sense if it ever made sense that planning law allows construction work to start when the permit is still being contested in front of the tribunal or the law courts” The Labour leader said the time had come to discuss such reforms but did not spell out any specific proposals as he warned that this could be a complicated matter were different interests will clash In his speech in front of a crowd of supporters in Valletta Abela – who like his predecessor’s refuses to regularise the property market – emphasised the need for affordable housing saying this was the “next big step” “The next step is to ensure that government takes initiatives to build a strong stock of apartments at affordable prices to target those who want to become home owners but cannot irrespective of the many initiatives we have already taken” he said In his closing remarks Abela reassured the crowd that “I am with you” adding that his administration still had four more years and promised to remain close to the people “We will not be perfect in everything and this is why we have to continue learning from you” he said before adding that Labour supporters should take courage in the fact that his government will be putting in more hard work in the coming years to implement its 1000 electoral promises and support workers young people pensioners and families “You know where you stand with us We deliver what we promise” Abela said before closing off his brief speech with former Labour strongman Dom Mintoff’s famous slogan “Malta first and foremost”

Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over hospitals concession deal – NAO,"May 15, 2023 5:41 PM",Former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval a damning NAO audit shows The new audit report states that Mizzi acted in “haste” and the transfer was authorised “unilaterally” without “the appropriate sanction” by the Cabinet of ministers The requests by VGH were only discussed in Cabinet on 9 January 2018 “days after the approvals” by the then tourism minister had already been granted the report says After racking up €36 million in debts VGH then agreed to transfer the contract to Steward Healthcare for a reported €1 The report also belies disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s claims that all decisions taken on the hospitals deal were taken by his Cabinet of ministers Speaking in the aftermath of the court judgment that annulled the concession agreement in February Muscat had claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and collective decisions by the Cabinet Mizzi is also accused of having misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” “The delegation of responsibility for a health concession to the Minister for Tourism was deemed illogical by the NAO and provided a convenient opportunity for the exploitation of Government creating weakness where there ought to have been none a weakness all to readily leveraged by the SHC” “The most evident exploitation was that secured by the SHC in terms of Government’s liability to pay €100000000 and the sum of the lenders’ debt to the Concessionaire in case of courtdeclared nullity of the concession agreements irrespective of the party attributed the default a situation precipitated by the Minister for Tourism and engineered through his misleading of Cabinet Compounding matters was that Cabinet’s authorisation was not sought by the Minister for Tourism in instances when Government acted as guarantor in several financing agreements entered into by the SHC and the BOV” In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months This came after former PN leader Adrian Delia opened a court case in 2018 in a bid to force the cancellation of the 99year emphyteutical concession agreement on the basis that the original concessionaire VGH and their heirs in title Steward Healthcare had not fulfilled their contractual obligations Depasquale had harsh words for all parties involved in the deal including government concessionaires VGH and Steward Healthcare and in a scathing sentence said government had failed to protect the national interest in the privatisation deal In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement” Defying all logic the judge said Mizzi granted VGH another three years automatically extendable for another year and a half that is four and a half years in total ie until the end of the year 2022 to do what they had failed to do by September 2018 The judge also pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back The latest report was tabled in parliament on Monday afternoon Government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament holds an urgent debate on the report published by the NAO But the Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO’s findings Moreover the National Audit Office expressed great concern that Mizzi refused to collaborate during the probe “It is with the gravest concern that the NAO views the failure of the Minister for Tourism to cooperate in this audit as inexcusable compounded no less by the centrality of his role in the concession The shirking of accountability on the part of the Minister for Tourism hampered this Office in its understanding of the initial developments that led to the concession being taken over by the SHC and impacted other aspects for which he assumed responsibility in relation thereto most notably in authorising the change of control and in representing Government as guarantor for funds secured by the SHC” In addition the NAO said it could not verify assertions made by others regarding the role played by Mizzi in this concession “The NAO holds a bleak view of the Minister for Tourism’s conduct in this respect for ministers of Government and public officials who have acted in the interests of the Government should find no difficulty in accounting for their decisions and actions The action on the part of the Minister for Tourism in not cooperating with the NAO was deemed deplorable”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"Stop ignoring eNGOs and environmental authorities, PN tells government","April 30, 2023 7:26 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Nationalist Party has stated that the Government cannot continue to ignore the opinion of environmental authorities and NGOs when it comes to planning decisions In a statement Nationalist MPs Julie Zahra and Stanley Zammit said that the defining characteristics of villages across the country are being threatened by planning policies that the Government “does not have the will to review” They said that all this happened despite the existence of several environmental authorities and entities such as the Superintendence for Cultural Heritage which have only been weakened by the Government and are nowadays only being treated as consultants or are even being ignored “The new style of construction not only clashes with other buildings but serves as a bad precedent to issue more permits which will continue to destroy these areas’ aesthetics and physiognomy” the MPs insisted They also warned that all this is leading to a situation where the Planning Authority PA manages the Superintendence as “its puppet” when they are in fact supposed to work hand in hand The two deputies appealed to the Government to “strengthen the competences of these entities with muchneeded investments in technology and human resources and also to ensure that the Superintendence and the PA are autonomous and work closer together”

Archbishop’s word of advice to those discerning God’s calling,"April 30, 2023 5:26 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “If anyone here is sensing Jesus’ calling I shall give you this piece of advice listen to Jesus’ voice in silence and in prayer while also taking the advice of those qualified to give it to you” This was Archbishop Charles Scicluna’s advice to those feeling the pull of religious vocation as he celebrated mass on the World Day of Prayer for Vocations in the chapel of the Minor Seminary – the same place where many individuals who welcomed God’s calling began their journey towards priesthood During the homily the Archbishop told those listening that God uses wise people and those who love us such as our parents to enlighten our conscience and heart While he appealed to those who feel God’s calling to seek his peace the Archbishop said that this applies not only to those who wish to become religious persons missionaries or priests but also to those who choose the path of marriage Mgr Scicluna went on to refer to the Second Reading from the First Letter of St Peter the Apostle where as a shepherd Jesus enters physically and personally as a guarantee for his sheep’s safety integrity health and life While praying that the Church continues to have shepherds for the Lord’s flock the Archbishop interpreted Vocations’ Day as a way of remembering the work done by the Church in Malta Just a few days ago Archbishop Scicluna had the opportunity to meet a number of people in charge of the various services provided by the Church in Malta – the diaconia Through the diaconia the service through which the Church offers a service in the fields of education health rehabilitation from addiction and protection from domestic violence the Church continues Jesus’ mission Faced with such a noble and important mission the Archbishop recited the words of the Gospel that “the harvest is great but the workers are few” and urged the faithful to keep seeking the voice of the good shepherd and obey His word
Workers should not be abused for sake of economic “success” – Church Commission,"April 30, 2023 4:26 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Justice and Peace Commission has expressed its concern regarding the injustices suffered by nonEU persons working in Malta saying that no worker should be abused for the sake of the country’s economic success While preparations for the celebration of Workers’ Day are underway the Commission set up by the Archdiocese of Malta expressed its concern about nonEU nationals who despite paying National Insurance contributions do not receive a pension In a statement the Commission explained that the current pension system relies on the assumption that nonEU workers will stay here for a few years pay social insurance contributions and leave before receiving a pension The Commission said that it believes that the kind of society implied by this model is socially unjust and morally unacceptable Explaining the situation these migrants find themselves in the Commission said that without any realistic possibility of making Malta their home nonEU workers do not benefit totally from the fiscal social contract in which people pay tax and in turn receive public goods and services including a pension Specifically in the absence of bilateral or EUwide agreements with their countries of origin these workers once they return to their country of origin can never expect any pension benefit in return for the National Insurance contributions they would have paid over the years in Malta This is in addition to the terrible treatment they receive as though they are some subservient underclass who never belong in the society they are working in Figures tabled recently in Parliament by Finance Minister Clyde Caruana show that National Insurance contributions by foreign workers increased by 570 from 2012 till 2021 reaching over €1 billion in total Over the same timeperiod these workers also paid over €13 billion in income tax with the yearly total increasing from nearly €48 million in 2012 to €250 million in 2021 The Commission insisted that the more than 40000 nonEU citizens currently working in Malta – 77 of whom were earning under €20000 a year in 2021 – deserve to be treated with respect and dignity and not forced to work in an exploitative labour marked under conditions often akin to modernday slavery “As a country we need to question our definition of economic success” the Commission said as it went on to quote Pope Francis who last year urged business leaders to measure success according to “the number of people who move out of extreme poverty” instead of “profits expansion and shortterm and shortestterm results” The Commission thus called for a new social contract in which the rights and dignity of all workers – including nonEU workers – are fully promoted and respected within an economic framework that restores and builds rather than exploits and destroys “Given that there can be no social justice without tax justice and no social cohesion if the rights and dignity of some are blatantly ignored an economic and pension system which depend on the use and abuse of taxpaying workers who are then left emptyhanded and discarded when no longer needed should be firmly and roundly rejected” it insisted
Standards commissioner asked to investigate officials who ignored NAO queries,"May 16, 2023 9:19 AM",Standards Commissioner Joe Azzopardi has been asked to investigate two public appointees – Malta Enterprise CEO Kurt Farrugia and State Aid Monitoring Board chair Paul Zahra – for their failure to comply with the National Audit Office’s requests for information concerning the hospitals concession managed by Vitals and Steward The NAO’s third report was published on Monday and its damning findings include the conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi had misled Cabinet when the concession was transferred from Vitals to Steward and that he had engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter But in his letter to the Office of the Standards Commissioner the independent political candidate Arnold Cassola – whose letters have initiated the lion’s share of the investigations tackled by the office to date – focused on a brief remark in the 450page report “Of concern to the NAO was that Malta Enterprise failed to reply to any of the queries submitted This Office sought information relating to the lease agreement entered into by Government with the QMUL for the Barts Medical School and an account of the payments received by Malta Enterprise in this respect Similarly queries submitted to the SAMB remained unaddressed” Auditor General Charles Deguara said This behaviour was deemed unacceptable by Cassola who accused Farrugia and Zahra of “attempting to sabotage the NAO’s inquiry into the misappropriation of over €400 million in public funds from Vitals and Steward at the expense of the Maltese public and in the complicity of a number of politicians including former minister Konrad Mizzi He described their behaviour as ‘omertà’ insisting that this was not acceptable “in a state that adheres to the democratic values of transparency and truth” Farrugia had been an integral part of former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s secretariat before being appointed as Malta Enterprise CEO in 2019 acting as head of government communication and Muscat’s spokesperson Earlier this year Cassola had asked the SAMB to investigate the concession following last February landmark judgment which cancelled it and deemed it “fraudulent” receiving no reply
IĠM calls on Abela to denounce illegal detention of journalists,"May 17, 2023 3:40 PM",The Institute of Maltese Journalists IĠM called on prime minister Robert Abela to denounce the illegal detention of journalists at Castille in 2019 This week a Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected In a statement on Wednesday IĠM stressed that such ugly scenes should not be repeated and said it expects the government to “disassociate itself from these three bullies – Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay – who were found guilty of illegally detaining journalists following a press conference by the Prime Minister” Although court found the men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest no action has been taken against officials at the Prime Minister’s Office then occupied by Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat On the day the three men who refused to identify themselves appeared to act as plainclothes security guards to keep the journalists from leaving the building “Not only were the journalists illegally detained but effectively silenced” IĠM said It added that it now expects the government to act to ensure that these men are not reengaged for government events “The authorities must ensure that similar incidents are not repeated and that journalists are allowed to go about doing their job with utmost freedom and respect and in an environment befitting the fourth estate of democracy”
Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul said Predictably he went on to suggest that the government would resist this and do the opposite
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”
Archbishop Charles Scicluna denies ever being an Opus Dei member,"May 17, 2023 8:00 PM",The Church in Malta has denied allegations made by a blogger that Archbishop Charles Scicluna is a member of Opus Dei “In a recent blog post Simon Mercieca a professor of history at the University of Malta alleged that Archbishop Charles Scicluna is a member of Opus Dei” the Curia said in a statement on Wednesday “This is totally untrue Contrary to the misleading statement made by Prof Mercieca the Archbishop is not and never has been a member of Opus Dei” the statement added
"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"Seven men with alleged links to Daesh, charged with terrorism","April 30, 2023 3:35 PM",Seven men were arraigned on Sunday evening after a joint police operation coordinated by Europol led to a crack down on a group of people who were disseminating “extremist material” Newsbookcommt understands that the individuals are linked to Daesh – a militant Islamist group and former unrecognised quasistate ISIS The arraignment took place under heavy security with the area behind the court cordoned off with barriers and heavy police presence around the courthouse in Valletta Some other 15 officers were also present in the courtroom The individuals aged between 21 and 27 were arrested during the early hours of Saturday morning following a joint investigation involving multiple police units and Europol One of the men a 25yearold was wearing a mask and was wearing a shoulder sling which was used to support what looked like a fractured left wrist Before magistrate Grima the seven pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges The charges range from publicly inciting terrorism activity through online and offline messages glorifying terrorist acts and promoting the execution of such acts They were also charged with recruiting and inciting others to participate in terrorist acts They also face charges of training other individuals to use explosive weapons and make use of other weapons or substances that are classified as dangerous with the aim of carrying out terrorist activities as well as receiving such training The men were charged with travelling or attempting to travel within the EU and outside of the bloc to plan prepare and commit or participate in terrorist acts fully knowing that they are part of a terrorist group They are also accused of financing organising or facilitating the travel They are also accused of producing distributing sharing importing exporting selling supplying to themselves and others material aimed at inciting or making others commit terrorist acts One of the men was also separately accused of making use of a passport that was issued in the name of another person and making alterations to that passport Six are from Homs and one is from Raqqa in Syria and work as plasterers in Malta Five of them live in Ħamrun one lives in TalPietà and one lives in Birkirkara AG lawyer Antoine Agius Bonnici asked the court to impose a freezing order on all the assets of the accused the request was upheld by the court Defence counsel José Herrera dictated a note in court saying the freezing order should only be imposed on the income which was generated from the alleged crime in order to safeguard the rights of the accused He referred to judgements delivered by the Constitutional Courts that have deemed Malta’s legislation as “draconian” Agius Bonnici rebutted the argument saying that the Proceeds of Crime Act does not distinguish between proceeds of crime and genuinely earned cash and therefore the freezing order hits all the assets of the accused He cited several judgments in which the courts did not find it draconian Herrera explains the reason behind dictating such a note saying that this was due to other judgements delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal amongst others that recently declared that it could not scrutinize the request He added that he raised this legal point at this stage to then show that he has made used of ordinary remedies available for his client Herrera argued that the law should be more balanced in its effect The court ordered the Assets Recovery Bureau to draw up an inventory of the assets of the accused including any immovables they own is in their control or is due to them as well as any cash Herrera did not request for bail However he made a comment saying the AG exaggerated the charges “The accused are facing two terrorism charges one punishable by 30 years imprisonment and the other punishable by a lifetime imprisonment” Herrera started off and added that “knowing the proof that there is against the men it is like one cast a net and caught a bit of everything” “I expected to see charges relating to computer misuse and incitement of hatred If one sings the anthem of an illegal group it does not make him a terrorist If I sing Mussolini’s anthem it does not make me a Nazi Having the flag of a terrorist organisation does not mean I am going to carry out a terrorist attack The charges have been trumped up and are exaggerated” “We will not ask for bail at this stage but we will wait until the evidence comes out in court where it will be seen that this is all hullabaloo” he concluded Agius Bonnici rebutted that hate speech is regulated under different provisions of the law and the charges relate to terrorism and the financing of terrorism “The investigation took several months and during the raids the police seized mobile phones and several devices at their residence There is a large volume of documents which need to be sifted through and analysed We gave full disclosure of what we have until to day” Agius Bonnici said AG lawyers Antoine Agius Bonnici Francesco Refalo and Rebekah Spiteri led the prosecution assisted by police

"ADPD focuses on price increase of daily needs, living wage in May Day speech","April 30, 2023 12:41 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Judicious use of Malta’s resources is needed to better address the cost of living challenges ADPD said on Saturday In a press conference at Ta’ Qali’s farmers market the party commemorated Workers’ Day by focusing on the challenges being faced by households with the exponential increase in the cost of living The party insisted that this should be addressed by a judicious use of the country’s resources highlighting that while it’s commendable to subsidise the basic energy and water consumption for residential use it disagreed with a blanket acrosstheboard subsidies saying they did not make sense “While as a country we cannot control what happens outside our borders we do have a duty to do all that is necessary for ensuring a decent standard of living for all Positively we note that our proposal of adjusting wages for cost of living twice a year instead of an annual adjustment at budget time has been taken up by trade unions Hopefully we can in the near future see developments in this direction” the party said as it called for the adoption of a living wage The party’s deputy chairperson Sandra Gauci said that people are feeling the pinch of the cost of living more than ever “The increased price of daily needs are unbelievable Every week going to the supermarket is a nightmare If you have young children or a chronic illness which requires medication or a food allergy you are in for unpleasant surprises Government has managed only to subsidise flour People are struggling as the problem is not just flour or wheat derived products To make matters worse the office of consumer affairs is completely absent Various consumers have reported prices on the shelf which do not match the ones at the cash prices not being displayed or the sorry excuse for the price hike that it is new stock” she said Gauci called on the consumers’ watchdog to carry out spot checks to ensure that shelf prices match the actual prices being charged She also observed that employees are working longer hours or find a side job to maintain their standard of living Gauci added that the finance minister Clyde Caruana has ruled out a fourday week and remarked that nurses are expected to work a 56hour week instead The party also called for the studies on the living wage proposal to be concluded and published “Even though we have a government continuosly boasting of economic growth according to Eurofund our country has had the lowest increase in the minimum wage across all of Europe One inevitably asks who is gaining from this reported economic growth” she asked The party’s chairperson Carmel Cacopardo said that there is definitely a case to retain subsidised energy and water use in order to mitigate the social impacts of an increase in rates in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine However such subsidies should be focused on those who need them The basic energy and water consumption of residential households should definitely remain protected and subject to subsidies in the medium term “This is a social necessity to protect the vulnerable and low earners However beyond subsidies applied to basic and essential energy and water consumption there are no valid reasons for the current across the board subsidies of residential households Those who can afford to run large domestic properties should be able to shoulder the increased cost of the energy and water they consume beyond basic consumption” he said Cacopardo observed there was no social need to subsidise fuel and that there are only a small number of cases where private vehicle use is required to address issues of disability and for which subsidies make sense “Removal of fuel subsidies would signify a substantial increase in the price of petrol and diesel The primary impact of the removal of subsidies applied to petrol and diesel would be beneficial as it would signify an immediate reduction of cars from our roads more judicious use of cars and a substantial improvement in air quality” he said

"Cassola asks Standards Commissioner to investigate Abela, the Muscats","April 30, 2023 10:50 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Independent candidate Arnold Cassola has asked Standards Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi to investigate prime minister Robert Abela and his predecessor Joseph Muscat and Muscat’s wife Michelle The request for an investigation comes on the back of an anonymous letter Cassola received in which it was alleged that Michelle Muscat is being ferried around by two drivers whose salaries are being footed by Maltese taxpayers The drivers’ names and ID card were provided by the sender If this turns out to be true then prime minister Robert Abela would have lied to the House of Representatives when he was asked to provide information about Muscat’s severance package in Parliament Abela had told Parliament that the Muscats had also the use of second car which was the same car being used while Joseph Muscat was prime minister but the services of a driver were not included and this was done in terms of the severance package approved in December 2019 According to the anonymous letter the two drivers were assigned to Michelle Muscat in 2013 right after the Labour Party was elected into power A director within a governmental department had assigned them The director is now a director general of the same department The anonymous sender details how after Muscat was forced out of office due to the 2019 protests amid the fallout from the investigation of Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder the two drivers were seconded to Marigold Foundation which is run by Michelle Muscat herself The drivers work on dayin dayout shift basis and are still ferrying Michelle Muscat to this very day the anonymous sender signing as “concerned citizen” alleges The letter also details the name of the officer who signs for their salary overtime and allowances In his letter to Azzopardi Cassola says “Whilst one needs to be cautious given it is an anonymous letter the details are so precise that it merits an investigation” Cassola requested the Standards Commissioner to investigate Abela to see whether he lied to the House or not He also requested him to investigate Joseph and Michelle Muscat on the basis of their diplomatic passports and therefore qualify as “politically exposed persons” He also requested an investigation into the Muscats for potential abuse of power given that Michelle Muscat makes use of a service provided by two drivers that according to prime minister Abela “they do not exist”

Accused officers in detention death still on Army payroll,"April 30, 2023 8:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Two soldiers continued to serve with the Armed Forces of Malta despite having been charged in connection to the 2012 murder of Mamadou Kamara an escaped detainee One of the accused is still a Lance Bombardier to this very day while the other retired in 2018 after 25 years of service A third soldier had been discharged on medical grounds and was later acquitted on appeal after he had been found guilty by the first court of tampering with evidence Kamara had died in the back of a detention service van shortly after being repeatedly kicked in the groin According to forensic expert Mario Scerri the Malian migrant had died as a result of the blunt trauma he sustained which had triggered a vasovagal attack The details about the three AFM soldiers emerged from a reply home affairs minister Byron Camilleri by Opposition MP Albert Buttigieg who asked the minister whether three individuals whom he inquired about were still part of the Armed Forces and if yes to confirm their rank He also asked the minister to provide details of their resignations or confirm whether they were fired The three officers in question are Gordon Pickard Mark Anthony Dimech and Clive Cuschieri However it is only Dimech and Cuschieri that are undergoing separate criminal proceedings for the murder Dimech and Cuschieri – then part of the AFM’s First Regiment were stationed at the Safi Detention Centre when they were arraigned in 2012 They pleaded not guilty to the homicide of Kamara They were also accused of causing him serious injury and committing a crime they were dutybound to prevent The pair was granted bail in 2012 against a €9000 deposit and a personal guarantee of €30000 To date the pair are still awaiting trial by jury According to the minister’s reply Dimech completed 25 years of service and retired in February 2018 while Cuschieri remains a Lance Bombardier at the AFM Newsbookcommt is informed that while a bill of indictment has been issued in their case they are still awaiting trial In 2017 Pickard testified in the court proceedings against the two men On the day of Kamara’s death Pickard had been in charge of the 12man shift on duty The personnel were a mix of detention officers and AFM In court Pickard had described the steps taken  to deal with troublesome inmates including in case of misbehaviour He recalled that sergeant Dimech had made the decision after other migrants did not want Kamara to stay with them Recalling the incident Pickard said Kamara had been taken to a health centre after requesting to be seen to by a doctor He was certified as healthy but an appointment was made for a psychiatrist to see him the next day Kamara was returned to Block B and a commotion broke out as other detainees objected to his presence Dimech according to the witness took the decision to place him in isolation It was while he was being transferred that Kamara took off Pickard recalled chasing Kamara for around 200 metres before the latter jumped over the fence The officers then left with a detention centre van to recapture the escapee The witness joined the officers with his personal vehicle and saw Kamara jumping over a wall Eventually he saw Cuschieri kicking Kamara twice in the abdomen and head According to the witness the migrant lashed out at the officers but he was eventually detained and placed in the van Kamara allegedly tried to hit out at the officers again with Pickard calling the detention centre to prepare handcuffs Dimech handcuffed Kamara’s feet whilst other soldiers cuffed his hands Pickard recalled that the victim stopped struggling once he had handcuffs on Dimech had gone to see a doctor because of the bruises he suffered while Pickard went to get a wheelchair The migrant was unresponsive with Pickard recalling that he initially thought Kamara was faking it to escape However a doctor arrived and certified the man dead Furthermore according to Pickard’s testimony Cuschieri had kicked Kamara while he was trying to get up In court Cuschieri’s lawyer Stephen Tonna Lowell had objected to the prosecution making reference to a statement his client made without the presence of his lawyer Pickard has since been acquitted by an appeals court of tampering with evidence related to the investigation into the death of the 32yearold migrant The judgement was delivered on 30 November 2016 however Pickard worked up until May 2016 within the Armed Forces of Malta He was discharged on medical grounds according to the minister In February 2015 Magistrate Antonio Vella condemned Pickard to 18 months imprisonment after concluding that the trio had agreed to falsely claim that the migrant had been struggling violently with them The Court of Criminal Appeal however acquitted Pickard and noted that the Court of Magistrate’s sentence did not address and placed no emphasis on the precise circumstances that could have led to this crime being committed The Court of Criminal Appeal observed that false declarations to the police did not constitute the crime of tampering with evidence and this provision dealt with the material traces of the crime Madam Justice Edwina Grima held that making a false declaration of what had occurred to the police “can never constitute” the crime of suppression or destruction of evidence It was observed that while the Court of Magistrates reached the conclusion that the actions of the members of the AFM had been intended as a mise en scene it was only on the basis of conjecture and not concrete evidence It was also noted that Pickard gave a detailed account of what went down on the day in his second statement to the police The Court of Criminal Appeal observed that Pickard had chosen to withdraw any previous declarations and criminal proceedings against Cuschieri and Dimech had been based on Pickard’s statement The 2012 independent inquiry into the running of the Detention Services had concluded that excessive force had been used or allowed to be used on Kamara The use of such force led to his death The inquiry published in December 2014 had also concluded that the detention services officers had been negligent when they did not close off the gates allowing the migrant to escape It also concluded that Kamara had been beaten while in custody of detention officers adding that it is up to the court to determine criminal responsibility The same inquiry had put forward 21 recommendations in relation to the detention services including a revision of Malta’s detention policy including a revision on its length and quality which is detrimental to both migrants and the perception of the same migrants by Maltese society The inquiry had recommended a shorter period of detention in line with the international conventions and the European Convention on Human Rights It called for a right to contest one’s detention and that such contestation should be expedite and effective “To wait for almost a year for a decision to be taken is unacceptable and renders that right ineffective” the inquiry report had concluded

Muscat received payments from Swiss firm that was previously called VGH Europe,"May 17, 2023 10:12 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat received two payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group This has emerged from the corruption probe into Muscat as part of an investigation into potential corruption related to the Vitals Global Healthcare VGH deal The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe linked to the hospitals’ deal according to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Investigators are probing whether a potentially bogus consultancy contract was drawn up to justify the €60000 in consultancy payments Muscat received from SpringX Media and Accutor Consulting which used to be called VGH Europe Although Muscat denies any link between the payments and Vitals the company’s name was changed to Accutor Consulting AG in January 2018 just before Steward Healthcare took over the hospitals’ concession from VGH Muscat was paid a total of €60000 to his Bank of Valletta account in 2020 the first payment taking place just two months after he stepped down in January of that year The former prime minister received four monthly payments two from Accutor AG and two from Spring X Media another Swiss firm run by the same owner – Pakistani businessman Wasay Bhatti Spring X Media is registered at the same Swiss address as Accutor AG and the two companies carried out transactions between each other The Accutor AG payments to Muscat were made under the terms of an indefinite consultancy contract drawn up between himself and Spring X Media in February 2020 just one month after he resigned Despite the indefinite nature of the consultancy contract signed when Muscat was still an MP the payments ended abruptly in the summer of 2020 The contract was to earn Muscat €15000 a month for three years for a total of €540000 It was also to be automatically renewed for another three years before it was suddenly stopped after four monthly payments when Accutor went out of business Muscat’s residence was searched by police in January 2022 as a result of an inquiry anticorruption NGO Repubblika requested in 2018 But Muscat denied that the search had anything to do with his Accutor contract or suspicions that it was bogus and merely a vehicle to receive kickbacks from the hospitals’ deal Likewise the reports say that former minister Konrad Mizzi’s home has also been searched as part of the probe and had his smartphone confiscated by police Transactions of Accutor AG the Swiss payroll company that played a key role in funnelling funds from VGHSteward and Bluestone show that the companies sent at least €7 million to Accutor which then directed payments toward VGH directors and behindthescenes investors According to his 2020 tax return Muscat declared an income of almost €482000 from various consultancy work in the year he resigned as prime minister The earnings were covered by a flurry of consultancy contracts Muscat signed in the weeks and months after resigning Following an unprecedented political and institutional crisis Muscat announced his resignation in December 2019 but actually resigned in January 2020 Muscat baulked under the pressure of weeks of protests following the the emergence of alleged links between government officials and the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and the arrest of Yorgen Fenech Fenech is awaiting a trial after being accused of masterminding the murder Moreover his Dubairegistered company 17 Black allegedly intended to funnel money to two Panama companies belonging to then energy minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s right hand man Keith Schembri According to The Times prime minister Robert Abela is wary of the inquiry’s outcome as he is concerned that highprofile arrests and possible prosecutions could throw the Labour Party into disarray Sources said police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police Moreover the investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella According to the reports Muscat claimed that he had been introduced to Bhatti “years back” by his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and that Bhatti got in touch with him “after I announced my resignation” “Strongly refuting” the allegations about the contract Muscat insisted that he has “carried out legitimate and documented work in connection with my contract” However when asked to provide any such documented evidence Muscat refused saying “It is evidence that shows the projects I have been working on and meetings held “I do not believe I should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “everything was carried out accordingly”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing

“What about police investigation into Sofia’s death?” Kamra tal-Periti president asks,"April 29, 2023 5:20 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “What happened to the police investigation into Jean Paul Sofia’s death” Kamra talPeriti Andrè Pizzuto asked on Saturday morning noting that the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the case does not stop the police from investigating on their own steam Pizzuto was one of the guests during Andrew Azzopardi on 103 a talk show hosted by Professor Andrew Azzopardi Whilst the main discussion centered on whether Malta’s buildings are earthquake proof Azzopardi asked Pizzuto on the case of Sofia 20 who was killed under the rubble of a construction site that collapsed late last year The architect observed that the police investigations are different from the magisterial inquiry and added that it was not the first time that the police arraigned suspects before a court and the inquiry had not been concluded yet citing the murder of Pelin Kaya as one such case Under the Criminal Code the duties of the police are provided for in Article 346 which states that “It is the duty of the Police to preserve public order and peace to prevent and to detect and investigate offences to collect evidence whether against or in favour of the person suspected of having committed that offence and to bring the offenders whether principals or accomplices before the judicial authorities” It has also been a longstanding practice that the police continue their investigations whilst there is an ongoing inquiry and if they decide on arraigning someone in connection to a case the officers would file an application before the duty magistrate asking them to conclude the investigate and send the inquiry report to the Attorney General Earlier this month prime minister Robert Abela blamed the inquiring magistrate for “inaction” and wrote to Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti complaining However his letter appears to suggest that the authorities are resting solely on the work of Magistrate MarseAnn Farrugia even though an open magisterial inquiry does not preclude the police from carrying out investigations on their own – and arraigning suspects accordingly Despite the police’s failure to produce results the OPM has to date note published any correspondence suggesting that Abela has urged police commissioner Angelo Gafà to address “unacceptable delays” on a sensitive case as he has done with the Chief Justice Speaking on Andrew on 103 Pizzuto expressed his concern about the pressure being placed on the inquiring magistrate “I am annoyed at the pressure being placed on the inquiring magistrate which is putting her work in doubt and this is not fair since the magistrate in question cannot rebut such claims” Pizzuto said in reference to repeated claims made by Abela Abela has repeatedly deflected demands for a public inquiry into the case by blaming the inquiring magistrate and has deliberately conflated the two types of inquiries despite a public inquiry is different in scope to a magisterial inquiry Pizzuto insisted that Abela should not assume that an inquiry is simple “The prime minister does not know what went on and what is going on One cannot simply assume If the material is being tested this cannot be done in Malta” he explained as called for more measured words Whilst Kamra does not have an official position on the public inquiry he added that it would have no objections to efforts aimed at establishing any shortcomings in the system which need to be addressed
Former Xagħra mayor clarifies his resignation; lambasts clientelism plaguing electoral system,"April 29, 2023 4:25 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Former Xagħra mayor Christian Zammit has clarified why used the expression “tolgo il disturbo”  or “the time has come to get out of the way” Writing on Facebook for the first time since he announced he stepped down as Xagħra mayor Zammit observed that he had repeatedly declared that the system was “sick” and underlined that politics is there to serve the community not for it to prostitute itself to big business “Many argue that this has always been the case… but they are wrong We need to change and mature” Zammit wrote “Why as a country we do not address the links between politics and big business Why does our political system allow for large scale money laundering How are the main political parties financed Who is financing candidates and their companies Why is clientelism the backbone of our electoral system Why are the two parties hostage of this sick system” The mayor asked why thousands of voters have had enough of the two main parties and want a third party to “shock” the system He argued that he could have stayed on earning €700 a month in honorarium “I could have pocketed €700 a month that for those who have a normal salary are more than welcome But why stay on when I had no power It’s not about the threats insults and daily nagging that bothers me but the feeling that you are completely alone and powerless” he wrote Zammit underlined that someone had to shock the system He dismissed claims that he became a Nationalist saying the party does not have a direction and is hostage to its debts and obligations He added that the party is miles away from his liberal values “Did I betray Labour No At least I hope I was an eyeopener to the party and that things need to change” he said Gżira mayor Conrad Borg Manché has come out to support Zammit saying that over the past eight years the biggest challenge was the audacity of certain people who feel above the law “Aside from these difficulties protests took place precisely because of this problem which permeated the country and destroyed it” Borg Manché wrote The public inquiry into the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia which had concluded that the state should shoulder the responsibility of the journalist’s murder had also shed light on the links between politics and big business The inquiry had recommended legal amendments to deter the use of political or financial power to escape justice It also recommended the introduction of laws to ensure absolute transparency and accountability in the relationship between government and big business as well as the regulation of lobbying The inquiry report also urged the introduction of unexplained wealth orders

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

were asked to keep the agreement confidential Caruana said “I am only aware that in the compensation process for workers exposed to asbestos those who are still alive were given compensation a while ago while the heirs of workers who died were also given compensation” Claiming that he was unaware of the meeting held with the heirs at the General Workers’ Union headquarters in Valletta Caruana said questions should be sent in writing This newsroom is awaiting replies to questions sent both to the Ministry and the GWU The cases date back decades and some 200 workers have since died because of the damage sustained from the exposure to asbestos In October 2021 social justice minister Michael Falzon and Caruana announced the compensation scheme which saw compensation ranging between €5800 and €16600 with the largest amount being offered to the worst affected by the condition Back then Caruana and Falzon announced that 49 workers had already been compensated The ministers had also said that four medical doctors evaluated each case to ensure the compensation was justified They had also explained that compensation was being offered on three criteria the severity of the disability the duration of sickness as well as the age in which one died – in the cases where compensation is received by the heirs Caruana had said that out of the 300 submissions made some 200 had unfortunately passed away The scheme was announced following a spate of court cases initiated by former dockyard workers and their heirs who sued government the dockyard and other State authorities In 2020 the heirs of a former dockyard worker who died following his exposure to asbestos for 28 years were awarded almost €150000 in compensation after a constitutional court found that the man’s right to life had been breached The Constitutional Court substantially increased the compensation awarded by the First Hall of the Civil Court which had previously awarded the family €35000 in pecuniary damages and €5000 in moral damages increasing them to €119400 and €28000 respectively Alexander Falzon worked at the dockyard as a carpenter between 1980 and 2008 and eight years later he was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma when he was just 54 and because of exposure to asbestos at his place of work He spent two years fighting cancer but died in April 2018 On 25 January 2019 court awarded 17 former shipyard workers and their heirs compensation after they were exposed to asbestos While court said that none of the applicants had been diagnosed with cancer it ordered that they should receive €3000 in compensation for the suffering caused A year earlier heirs of a dockyard worker were awarded nonpecuniary damages of €12000 after a judge ruled that worker’s right to life was violated through his constant exposure to deadly asbestos Emanuel Caruana’s widow and four children had sued the Chief Government Medical Officer and the Attorney General after medical certificates showed beyond doubt that the pensioner’s death in September 2005 had been caused by years of exposure to the deadly substance while working at Malta Drydocks The former labourer passed away after a ninemonth long battle against lung cancer at the age of 71 ten years after his retirement In 2014 the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that the Maltese State failed to protect shipyard workers from exposure to asbestos Upholding a violation of the right to life and the right to respect for private and family life of ship repair workers who were exposed to asbestos for a number of decades beginning in the 1950s to the early 2000s the European Court of Human Rights said “at least from the early 1970s the Maltese government had been aware or should have been aware that the shipyard workers could suffer from consequences resulting from the exposure to asbestos yet they had taken no positive steps to counter that risk until 2003” The Strasbourg court had ordered Malta’s government to pay €30000 jointly to the applicants in one of the four cases €12000 to John Mary Abela €1000 to Francis John Dyer and €9000 to each of the remaining applicants and €24000 to all claimants jointly in legal expenses The applicants – 21 Maltese nationals – were the immediate family of employees of the Malta Drydocks run by the government from 1968 to 2003 who had been exposed to asbestos and in certain cases suffered conditions – and in one case passed away of a malignant cancer – linked to exposure to asbestos Asbestos is dangerous when it is dispersed into the air as very small fibres that are invisible to the naked eye The asbestos mineral was commonly used in the manufacturing industry for its resilience to damage by heat electricity and chemicals In the 1970s it was discovered to be highly carcinogenic and was widely banned Breathing in asbestos fibres can lead to asbestosis a scarring of the lung tissue or even lung cancer If the asbestos fibres are only weakly bound into the product or material because of the fragility or condition of the productmaterial then that increases the risk of fibres being released According to a study by the European Commission there have been suggestions that asbestos exposure may lead to cancer of the larynx or of the gastrointestinal tract Ingestion of asbestos eg in contaminated drinking water has been suspected as a cause of gastrointestinal cancer and at least one study has shown an increased risk from unusually high concentrations of asbestos ingested in drinking water

Occupy Justice demands reopening of Egrant inquiry,"May 17, 2023 9:39 AM",Activists from Occupy Justice staged a protest outside Castille on Tuesday evening calling for the Egrant inquiry to be reopened “The reopening of the Egrant Inquiry is long overdue You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves for ignoring this History will not be kind to you for betraying those you were duty bound to serve and protect  Take action or resign” the activists warned Robert Abela’s administration In September 2021 Magistrate Ian Farrugia called for the reopening of Egrant inquiry  However to date the Attorney General has failed to take any action In spite of recent revelations regarding the Egrant Inquiry and all the dirty manoeuvres by Pilatus Bank officials and employees Occupy Justice said “there hasn’t been so much as a peep of action from the Floriana Police Depot or the Attorney General’s office” The magisterial inquiry into Pilatus Bank ordered that the Egrant inquiry be reopened after finding reasonable suspicion that 11 million were transferred from Azerbaijan to an account at Pilatus Bank through a parallel and secretive accounting system Murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had claimed that Egrant was owned by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s wife Michelle and the company received a payment of US1017 from Leyla Aliyeva daughter of Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev The Muscats vehemently deny these allegations An inquiry ordered by Muscat had found no evidence linking him and his wife to the secret Panama company but the owner remains unknown to this day “Whilst they’re dragging their feet and coming up with excuses to justify their inaction making sure that justice is delayed criminals roam free and are gifted years of a headstart to cover their tracks It seems that our institutions are spinelessly hell bent in protecting fraudsters and corrupt individuals instead of investigating them” Occupy Justice said Reminding finance minister Clyde Caruana that on 1 November 2019 he pledged to make available all necessary resources should there be ‘a request’ to reopen the Egrant Inquiry Occupy Justice said “that request was made by Magistrate Ian Farrugia who called for it to be reopened The Attorney General was legally obliged to comply with Magistrate Farrugia’s order Instead this was ignored – not that we’ve come to expect better from this office” “Well here we are making the request again We’re also demanding that this time round the terms for the Inquiry are not drafted by the prime suspect in the case It is laughable that this happened in the first place” They added that the contempt with which the Labour administration has treated the Maltese people for these past ten years is unprecedented “using its privilege and power to shield those who should have faced justice years ago All this makes us wonder as to who is really pulling the strings”

‘The end result of living in a mafia state is death’ – Pia Zammit,"May 16, 2023 7:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “If you refuse to listen to the voices of the living then you will be forced to hear the screams of even more dead” activist Pia Zammit said in a speech at the 67th monthly vigil commemorating Daphne Caruana Galizia Echoing the phrase from antiMafia activists in Italy and elsewhere Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked harassed and vilified before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much” she said “If you truly want justice for her stories then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice To protect them from threats and physical harm What are you waiting for More deaths” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection In her speech Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country and a mafia state” adding that people fall in three camps those who endorse corruption those who turn a blind eye to corruption and those who actually see the full picture “However we’re all experiencing the full picture whether we like it or not” she said as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue  The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law” Zammit said “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women” Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime” He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree” Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice that they are not alone “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat ‘We will get there’ Sa Naslu is true It will happen if we don’t give up It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other” Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly or tells me that I will at least be here to see it the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Malta still needs to address wounds caused by the ‘interdett’ – Fr Anton D’Amato,"April 28, 2023 8:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The wounds caused to Maltese society by the 1961 interdiction against the Malta Labour Party have yet to be properly addressed according to Fr Anton D’Amato who is proposing the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission to help address them Fr D’Amato was expressing his opininon whilst participating in a discussion on Andrew Azzopardi on 103 together with historian Joe Pirotta who has focused his research on the final years of Malta’s colonial period The present director of the Archdiocese of Malta’s Migrants Commission Fr D’Amato had written a dissertation on the interdiction when he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Theology in 2019 Both highlight that the general public holds many misconceptions about what the interdiction actually meant For one the interdiction itself was imposed on members of the MLP executive and not on party delegates Pirotta highlights that Malta’s bishops – Archbishop Michael Gonzi and Gozo Bishop Joseph Pace – had rushed to issue the interdiction on the executive before Labour convened its general assembly to avoid interdicting hundreds of party delegates And one of the most notorious consequences of the interdiction – the burial of people on grounds in the Addolorata Cemetery which were not blessed and which were described as the “ilmiżbla” – had impacted 7 people most notably the author Gużè Ellul Mercer who was MLP deputy leader at the time However both make clear that the impact of the interdiction should not be downplayed if anything rather the opposite “If you were a member of the party – or even if you just read the newspapers or attended its activities – you were treated as though you were interdicted” Pirotta observed “Even if many statements made on this period may be misconceptions this doesn’t mean that the facts didn’t happen that a lot of hurt wasn’t caused and that this pain is still being felt” Fr D’Amato said Over the years both Archbishop Joseph Mercieca in a 1988 pastoral letter and Archbishop Charles Scicluna in 2019 asked for forgiveness for the Church’s actions during that period in history Fr D’Amato describes the interdiction as an intergenerational trauma that was still being passed from a generation to the next despite the passing of decades “The issue between the church and the Labour Party has been officially resolved but the greatest hurt – the one that is still inherited – is the internal division that was created in each person” he pointed out This divide was exacerbated by the fact that those impacted by the interdiction saw themselves as devout Catholics an assessment Fr D’Amato concurs with In fact the only woman buried in a tomb which was not blessed as a result of the interdiction – Liza Zammit – was killed when she was run over by a car on her way home from mass “There were people who held a strong faith – their lives practically depended on the church – but who also held political beliefs that were practically as strong” Fr D’Amato said “And how did this resolve itself I feel it hasn’t yet” Pirotta also dismissed another misconception about the interdiction – that it was somehow motivated by hatred felt by the church or Mgr Gonzi towards Labourites The late archbishop as Pirotta pointed out had a workingclass background and had even been elected as a Labour senator in the 1920s But the archbishop’s greatest fear was that Malta’s Catholic identity was under threat and he was convinced that the MLP led by Dom Mintoff represented one of the greatest threats This perception was not helped by the realities of the Cold War era and while the 1950s saw socialist parties across Europe distance themselves from communist ones and from the Soviet Union the official line of the Church – which Gonzi followed – made no such distinction that only arrived in the 1960s “When Gonzi quoted the Osservatore Romano and said that one cannot be a socialist and a good Catholic he was quoting it correctly” Pirotta pointed out taking time to address another misconception that the Vatican was somehow opposing Mgr Gonzi’s actions In any case Pirotta emphasised the interdiction proved to be a miscalculation on Mgr Gonzi’s part “The idea was that Malta was so Catholic that he would act as a leader and everyone would follow” he noted “He failed to recognise that… the position of Mintoff was so strong by that time When people called him Malta’s saviour they believed him” the historian added Pirotta and Fr D’Amato both found themselves in agreement on the need not to sweep matters under the rug with the latter dismissing the suggestion that time heals all wounds “Time doesn’t heal wounds medicine does” Fr D’Amato observed “With time alone wounds will fester” It is with this in mind that he is suggesting the formation of a form of “truth and reconciliation commission” the model followed by South Africa as it sought to address the wounds caused by apartheid Pirotta on his part sees the failure to properly address such a difficult period in Malta’s recent history as a symptom of a greater malaise “We have managed to kill off the study of our history – especially modern history” the historian said “We are afraid of it and we are not able to face the realities we have gone through” By way of example he highlighted the repeated failure to build new purposelybuilt national archives a plot of land had actually been devoted for this purpose in Ta’ Qali in 2019 but these plans have now made way for a park “If we don’t preserve these things – and teach them – then this society won’t have a future” he concluded

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
MFA finds no evidence in sexual harassment case against former manager Mangia,"April 27, 2023 7:09 PM",The Malta Football Association did not find sufficient evidence to support the allegation of sexual harassment against the men’s national team manager Devis Mangia In November of last year the association accepted Mangia’s resignation who had previously been suspended following the alleged sexual harassment of at least two national team footballers In his letter of resignation Mangia had said that his decision was taken in the best interest of the national team to serenely face the football challenges which lie ahead However on Thursday the MFA said that its Safeguarding Board found no evidence to support the allegation of sexual harassment Moreover the association did not find sufficient evidence to support the allegation of grooming and the allegation of improper conduct “The Board decided that Mr Mangia shall be temporarily suspended from participating in any football activity in Malta until he enrols to a course on professional boundaries which he must complete within six months The course chosen needs to be approved by the MFA Safeguarding Board” the MFA said in a statement It added that a motivated decision will be sent to the parties in due course and the decision may be appealed In October 2022 the MFA filed a police report after two unnamed football players from the Maltese national team came forward alleging unwanted sexual advances by Mangiawho vehemently denied any wrongdoing Previously the MFA said it was “actively” and “constantly” evaluating all developments in relation to the case after local media reported an interview which appeared first in Romanian media in which the mother of Răzvan Popa alleged that her son was sexually harassed by Mangia when the latter was coaching League 1 at Craiova University
Keith Schembri claims Opposition MPs denied him fair hearing,"April 27, 2023 4:10 PM",Former OMP chief of staff Keith Schembri claimed Opposition MPs breached his right to fair hearing during the recent Public Accounts Committee meetings during which he testified on the Electrogas scandal This emerged from Constitutional proceedings filed by Schembri’s lawyers on Thursday with the former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s righthand man arguing that his right to a fair hearing had been breached Opposition MP rejected his request for a ruling from the Speaker to suspend his testimony until a criminal investigation is concluded Last week Schembri claimed that former finance minister turned Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and former deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta lied under oath leading to the Opposition members sitting on the committee demanding police commissioner Angelo Gafà to pursue criminal proceedings Schembri’s claims concerned the statements Scicluna – now governor of the Central Bank of Malta – and Valletta had made to the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia which found the state had to shoulder responsibility for her death However during Tuesday’s meeting PAC chair Darren Carabott informed Schembri that only MPs can demand a ruling by the Speaker After MPs sitting on the committee including Labour members did not move such a request themselves Schembri’s lawyer Edward Gatt informed the MPs that his client would not be answering any further questions as he would be seeking a judgement over the matter by the Constitutional Court Gatt said he would file a request in the Constitutional Court as to whether it was lawful that Schembri be made to testify when the PAC members had filed a related request for a perjury investigation In the Constitutional application filed this morning by Gatt and Mark Vassallo Schembri argued that the three Opposition MPs on the committee – Carabott David Agius Graham Bencini – should have recused themselves from deciding whether his request for a ruling should be accepted Describing this as a “manifest conflict of interest” the lawyers said that this breached the principle of not judging a case when they had an interest in its outcome “Not only did they not recuse themselves…but they blocked in every possible way every opportunity for a remedy requested by the applicant” The Opposition MPs Schembri’s lawyers argued had abandoned their positions as members of an impartial committee in favour of making themselves complainants against a person who was testifying before them by filing a premature criminal complaint before the testimony had even finished They also claimed that the incident had given rise to a “probably unprecedented” situation whereby a witness had been ordered to testify before the PAC in the Parliament building administered the oath by the President of the PAC replied to nearly four hours of questions put to him by three members of the same PAC who had requested – in their own name – a police investigation into the witness before he had finished testifying and above all a witness who had been asking for the protection of the Speaker of the House by asking the PAC President to refer his request for a suspension of testimony until the police investigations were complete “The respondents in their privileged position of power abused this position by themselves starting a criminal investigation into a witness who was still testifying before them and this without consulting with the rest of the Permanent Committee or putting this to a vote” Moreover Schembri’s lawyers claimed that he had not invoked his right to silence to avoid selfincrimination but had instead answered four hours of questions “Through their behaviour and with the political stunt they carried out the defendants reduced an important institution to ridicule…and clearly showed that their interest was not so much the public spending they were supposedly scrutinising but more that of scoring metaphorical political points” The application requests the First Hall of the Civil Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction to declare that Carabott Agius and Bencini had breached his right to a fair hearing as well as to declare that Parliament’s Standing Orders did not preclude a witness before a parliamentary committee from seeking the protection of the Speaker It also requests the defendants Darren Carabott David Agius Graham Bencini as well as the State Advocate and Speaker of the House to take the necessary measures to suspend Schembri’s testimony until the requested criminal investigation into perjury is concluded

Casa urges Europe’s largest trade union to back calls for Sofia public inquiry,"April 27, 2023 2:33 PM",MEP David Casa today wrote to Europe’s largest trade union confederation urging support for a public inquiry to protect workers in Malta as prime minister Robert Abela ostensibly refuses to order an independent probe into the death of a 20yearold man Jean Paul Sofia was killed in a construction site collapse last December and despite calls by the victim’s family the Opposition and civil society for a public inquiry Abela has all but ruled it out insisting that court proceedings were sufficient and claiming that an independent probe would obstruct the course of justice “His mother insists that a public inquiry is needed to prevent this from happening again to anyone else so that the death of her son would not be for nothing” Casa said on Thursday “Instead of support Jean Paul Sofia’s mother has found resistance from the authorities She should not have to go through political battles to ensure justice for her son and safety for all workers in Malta” the MEP added Insisting that a public inquiry was an international obligation incumbent on the Maltese state Casa said a public inquiry is needed “so as to ensure that workers no longer have to risk their lives because of shabby regulation commercial interests and unbridled greed” “Workers in Malta must be protected and it starts with a public inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia” Casa added The European Trade Union Confederation is a major trade union organisation representing dozens of national trade unions at the European level Maltese unions were also put in copy of the letter
Abela seeking to convince outspoken former Xagħra mayor to stay on,"April 27, 2023 1:28 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Prime Minister Robert Abela said he is seeking to convince outspoken Xagħra mayor Christian Zammit to return to the party and the local council after resigning on Thursday Yesterday Zammit who has been publicly critical on the state of Gozo’s environment and the threats posed by overdevelopment resigned from the council and the Labour Party’s Gozo regional committee “with immediate effect” However in complete disregard of Zammit’s immediate resignation and his unequivocal statement that he’s “getting out of the way to stop causing trouble” Abela said he was in contact with Zammit to resolve the issues that forced his resignation so that he could continue to serve as mayor In comments to the press on Thursday evening Abela said discussions with Zammit were still under way and he looked forward to welcoming him back to the party Abela said the former mayor had environmental issues at heart and the Labour Party needed people like him to continue pushing environmental initiatives adding that Zammit was his personal friend and he still had a lot to contribute to the party Likewise Gozo minister Clint Camilleri took to Facebook to urge Zammit to stay on insisting that the former Xagħra mayor “has a lot to offer” in local politics In an attempt to play down the apparent conflict within the party Camilleri said “there is no doubt that the Labour Party needs people like Christian within its ranks and likewise the country needs people like him in public roles” In a brief message on his social media Zammit – who unsuccessfully contested last year’s general election on the Labour ticket – announced that the he had taken the difficult decision to step down from the council without however giving a reason for this “Of course this was a very difficult decision considering that I have been active in the party and in politics for the last 23 years” he wrote adding that “the time has come to get out of the way” He also resigned from his post as president of the Labour Party’s Gozo regional committee While Zammit did not explain why he decided to resign as mayor and councillor in recent years he has been highly critical of the state of the environment in Gozo and a few days ago warned that partisanship was scaring people away from participating in local politics Following his failure to get elected in last year’s general election Zammit claimed that a scaremongering campaign by the construction industry to “eliminate” him was behind his dismal result A rare breed in Maltese politics Zammit did not fear taking on construction moguls such as Joseph Portelli describing some within the construction industry as “bullies” who were given airs by the major political parties His stance against overdevelopment in Gozo put him at loggerheads with elements within the Labour Party and in an interview last year Zammit said he was viewed negatively within the party “But I have always believed the Labour Party needs people who criticise it internally as I did on the environment because the moment this ends the party starts dying This is one of the PN’s main problems right now” Zammit had said Zammit had also backed Qala mayor Paul Buttigieg and his “honest crusade” to preserve Gozo especially the idyllic Ħondoq irRummien bay which was earmarked for the development of a hotel apartments villas residences restaurants shops as well as a yacht marina In recent months another mayor  – Conrad Borg Manchè  – was also highly critical of the Labour Party following plans which have now been blocked by court to turn part of a public garden in Gżira into a petrol station Accusing Labour of betraying its socialist principles Borg Manchè also took aim at party president Ramona Attard with the mayor accusing her of taking a stand in favour of handing over public land to greedy speculators and destroying a garden that has been enjoyed by the people for 120 years
Malta should revise ‘clearly defunct’ neutrality clause – Ranier Fsadni,"April 27, 2023 1:01 PM",Malta’s neutrality as enshrined in its Constitution is “clearly defunct” and should thus be revised including to reflect how security concerns have radically changed since it was written according to anthropologist and political commentator Ranier Fsadni Fsadni who lectures in political anthropology at the University of Malta made his remarks as he participated in a discussion organised by the Archdiocese of Malta’s Justice and Peace Commission which focused on the meaning of neutrality in the face of unprovoked aggression and whether the 1987 neutrality clause needed to be reviewed and redefined within the framework of a broader constitutional reform Fsadni reserved his strongest remarks on the clause for the QA session that followed the panel discussion when a member of the audience asked explicitly whether Malta should stick with the clause as is or change it The neutrality clause dates back to 1987 as a result of a compromise that also made possible a change in electoral laws that would prevent a repeat of the 1981 election which saw Labour returned to government despite obtaining fewer votes than the Nationalist Party Reflecting the period in which it was written – the Cold War in which two superpowers dominated international relations – it opens by stating that “Malta is a neutral state actively pursuing peace security and social progress among all nations by adhering to a policy of nonalignment and refusing to participate in any military alliance” going on to prohibit the hosting of foreign military facilities or personnel in Malta save for a few strictlydefined exceptions “Whether it’s good as it is depends on what you want out of it” Fsadni said as he answered the question put to the panel “It’s clearly defunct which enables any government to make it mean what it wants it to mean” While Fsadni recognised that a constitution could offer a degree of flexibility to governments this “full flexibility” clearly went beyond what a national constitution should be “So being distrustful of governments I would think that we need to rewrite it” he continued The main question he argued was whether this revision should be a minimalist one or a maximalist one the latter involved “reviewing what security means at an age where security involves ecological security and economic security” The discussion was organised to mark the 60th anniversary of the publication of Pacem in terris Peace on earth the last papal encyclical issued by St John XXIII published months after the Cuban Missile Crisis arguably one of the most dangerous periods of the Cold War The encyclical emphasised peace and the importance of human rights dignity and equality and  focused on both rights and obligations of people and states as well as on relations between countries Notably it was the first papal encyclical addressed to all people of good will rather than to Catholics alone reflecting the modernising efforts of the pope who launched the historic Second Vatican Council
Two-thirds of carers at SVPR hail from overseas,"April 27, 2023 9:20 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Foreign workers are crucial in keeping St Vincent de Paul Residence running as a parliamentary question reveals almost twothirds of the carers working in Malta’s largest care home hail from overseas This statistic was confirmed by minister Jo Etienne Abela in response to a question by opposition MP Ivan Bartolo with the minister stating that a total of 1167 nursing aides were employed at SVPR either directly or through private contractors While 406 nursing aides are Maltese nationals this number is dwarfed by the 761 who are not It is a figure that perhaps makes clear the important role of immigrants in Maltese society Foreign workers comprised no less than 296 of Malta’s workforce at the end of 2022 as the answer to a recent parliamentary question by Bartolo confirmed The increasing reliance on foreign workers to keep Malta’s care homes running has raised questions on language barriers but foreigners working in healthcare professions are required to pursue a course in basic medical Maltese to be able to communicate effectively with patients who may not be able to communicate in English

92 disembarked in Malta after rescue at sea this year,"April 26, 2023 7:09 PM",92 people – including an unaccompanied child – have been brought to Malta after being rescued at sea so far this year home affairs minister Byron Camilleri confirmed on Wednesday Camilleri was answering a parliamentary question by opposition MP Albert Buttigieg and he said that the disembarkations followed five rescues coordinated by the Armed Forces of Malta that took place between 3 February and 18 April Most of the asylum seekers brought to Malta – 60 – were brought to Malta in the latest rescue which took place amid increasing criticism from Italy on Malta’s apparent failure to assist people in distress within its searchandrescue area – criticism which echoes assertoins long made by NGOs including Alarm Phone In contrast to Malta the Italian home affairs ministry regularly publishes statistics on rescues at sea the figures published on Wednesday show that the country has taken in 38998 people this year Camilleri confirmed that the 92 people brought to Malta included no less than 75 Bangladeshis 11 Egyptians and 5 Sudanese and a person whose nationality has not yet been determined Though no such information was sought by Buttigieg Camilleri made a point of emphasising that “as soon as the asylum process is concluded we will start working to immediately return those not deserving of protection to their country of origin He highlighted that many of the people brought to Malta hail from countries with low recognition rates Maltese law now controversially includes an “accelerated procedure” for the processing of asylum claims for people considered to come from a “safe” country The list of safe countries is included in the International Protection Act and amended at the discretion of the home affairs minister At present it includes members of the European Economic Area – EU countries Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein – and 22 other countries none of which are European The legislation thus considers countries like Tunisia “safe” – despite widespread unrest that has led to a significant increase of Tunisians and nonTunisians alike seeking to reach Europe in recent months – whilst technically treating as unsafe all European nonEEA members including the UK and Switzerland Bangladesh and Egypt are also included on the list of safe countries and thus no less than 86 of the 92 people brought to Malta will face an accelerated procedure that is not short of controversy Last December a Bangladeshi journalist who sought asylum in Malta was awarded €5000 in damages after the European Court of Human Rights had found that his right to an effective remedy had been violated through the accelerated procedure NGO aditus whose lawyers represented the journalist had warned that the judgment may lead to “hundreds” of identical cases against Malta as it urged the country to change its asylum procedure without delay While both Malta and Italy lie on the same migration route Bangladeshis only account for a relatively small proportion of the people taken in by Italy The two primary nationalities of asylum seekers reaching Italy this year to date are the Ivory Coast 5810 and Guinea 4454 two countries which incidentally are not on Malta’s safe list

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul said Predictably he went on to suggest that the government would resist this and do the opposite
Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “criminal association to launder money originating from corruption” Aquilina described it as a “textbook case of money laundering” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country” “From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “remained silent and has not denied anything”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Court rules Daren Debono ‘it-Topo’ must testify in HSBC trial,"April 26, 2023 6:44 PM",Daren Debono must evidence before a magistrate in proceedings against Vince Muscat the Criminal Court said on Wednesday ruling that the defence was legally mistaken in arguing that Debono was not an admissible witness Muscat’s trial for his part in the 2010 botched holdup of the HSBC head office had been derailed by the lastminute admission made by Debono who is also accused of being involved in the hesit Last year Debono was jailed for ten and a half years after agreeing on a plea bargain after admitting his role in the heist but saw charges of homicide dropped by the Attorney General AG Debono better known as itTopo was granted a plea bargain at the eleventh hour before he was due to face trial alongside Vince Muscat better known as ilKoħħu with prosecutors dropping the attempted homicide charge in exchange for his evidence In February of last year Debono was sentenced to a sixmonth jail term and fined €4600 after being charged with failing to cooperate when called to testify against Muscat While testifying Debono repeatedly refused to reveal the identity of his accomplices in the attempted robbery of the HSBC headquarters in 2010 Moreover in 2017 Debono received a general interdiction for 20 years when he was found guilty of having fabricated evidence and lying under oath Following the surprise deal struck by the AG Muscat’s lawyers had vociferously objected to the newly convicted Debono being produced as a prosecution witness arguing that he had not been heard as part of the compilation of evidence and that this had deprived them of the opportunity to hear what he had to say and prepare their defence accordingly Subsequently the case was sent back to the court of magistrates so that compilation proceedings could resume and the new witness be heard However the case took another twist when Daren Debono then refused to testify citing fears for his safety and that of his family Muscat’s lawyers Roberto Montalto and Franco Debono had then filed a request to the Criminal Courtasking that the prosecution be prevented from using Debono as a witness during the trial arguing that he could not be trusted and because he had been placed under general interdiction in 2017 But in a decree handed down today Madam Justice Edwina Grima dismissed the request to bar Debono from testifying in the trial “It is the view of this court that the defence is basing its objections on a mistaken premise This is because contrary to what the defence is arguing Daren Debono was not accused and convicted of… perjury but of the offence of refusing to testify as a witness “That a witness mixes things up in his testimony or otherwise does not want to take the oath or testify as requested does not render that witness inadmissible…” “The law grants the Court wide discretion in how it manages witnesses and the wording of the law implies that a witness who is not telling the truth on the stand can be forced to tell the truth and remain a competent witness in spite of his reticence or reluctance to testify truthfully” On the defence’s claim that Debono had refused to be administered the oath court said this was untrue adding that when the court had repeated the oath more than once he had once again confirmed his oath although he had held that he feared for his safety and that of his family should he be obliged to name anonymous third parties Moreover after examining his abortive testimony before the court of Magistrates in February 2022 the judge ruled that it was evident that the witness had been ready to testify and in fact had started to give his testimony “but was finding it difficult to answer those questions which in his opinion could result in endangering himself and his family” Court added that once the Attorney General had reached a plea deal with the witness that rendered him competent to testify in these proceedings the AG with the help of the Commissioner of Police must also see to placing the witness and his family in a witness protection program as is his right The last word on granting this protection was the AG’s said the court pointing out that the public prosecutor could also request that Debono testify via video link from a remote location Rejecting the defence’s contention the court said it did not have a situation where a witness was refusing to be administered the oath as it was alleging and neither was it the case that the witness was refusing to obey the oath capriciously or that circumstances indicated that the witness was not going to tell the truth “Above all neither is it true that the witness was found guilty of perjury in the 27 October judgement against him but of the offence of refusing to testify A reticent or recalcitrant witness could be compelled to testify by the court and this attitude did not render his testimony as inadmissible a priori” The judge wrapped up her decree by pointing out that the law under which Daren Debono had been placed under a general interdiction in March 2017 for perjury or taking a false oath expressly stated that he was prohibited from serving as a witness “except before the courts of justice” which therefore meant that could serve as a witness in the trial Ruling that there was no reason for this development to displace the Criminal Court’s order given as part of a decree on January 6 2022 the judge ordered the acts of the case be sent once again before the Court of Magistrate for Daren Debono to testify also ordering the AG to see to it that the witness received all the protection that could be deemed necessary with the assistance of the Commissioner of Police

‘A victory for the people’: Court blocks relocation of fuel pump to Gżira garden,"April 26, 2023 1:47 PM",Gżira mayor Conrad Borg Manchè heralded a court decision to annul a Lands Authority decision to take back part of a public garden in Gzira as “a victory for the people” The controversial decision to turn part of a public garden into a petrol station in the locality had put the Labour mayor on a warpath with his own party with Borg Manchè accusing Labour of betraying its socialist principles Prior to today’s decision Borg Manchè also took aim at Labour Party president Ramona Attard who was representing the Lands Authority with the mayor accusing her of taking a stand in favour of handing over public land to greedy speculators and destroying a garden that has been enjoyed by the people for 120 years The Gżira local council which has administered the Yacht Marina Garden for 22 years had challenged the Lands Authority decision and the mayor welcomed the court’s decision on Wednesday as he thanked all involved including the media and those who had signed a petition to save the garden In his judgement Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff slammed the Lands Authority for its lack of consultation and respect towards natural justice as he confirmed a decision by the Administrative Review Tribunal that annulled the authority’s decision In November of last year the Administrative Review Tribunal annulled the decision by the Lands Authority to take back part of a public garden that had been leased to Gżira local council The authority had wanted to use 902 square metres of the garden for the relocation of a petrol station Following the authority’s decision to take up land for a petrol station the local council appealed arguing that the Lands Authority had never sent for the council representatives to hear what they had to say about the decision to claim back a substantial part of the garden that was administered for the benefit of the community The council claimed that the principle of audi alteram partem a basic tenet of natural justice had been violated Moreover the Lands Authority did not give reasons for its decision nor did it provide a copy of the decision taken by the board of governors The Gżira council had also insisted that the garden was the only green lung in an increasingly commercialised locality Moreover the local council also argued that the authority had failed to administer public property in the best manner possible and based its action on “irrelevant and inappropriate considerations” In a letter dated 11 April 2022 the Lands Authority had informed the local council that 902 square metres of the garden administered by it was being claimed back because it was needed by the government But today court confirmed the Administrative Review Tribunal’s ruling from last year with  Mr Justice Mintoff slamming the authority’s lack of consultation and respect for the people’s needs Court decreed that since the Lands Authority decision impacted on the general public including residents who frequented the garden it should have abided by “a higher level of transparency reasonableness and respect for natural justice” The Appeals Court also said that consultation with the local council should have been the bare minimum expected from a public authority when it took a decision impacting on the residents and the public Moreover the court shot down the various objections made by the Lands Authority which claimed that the tribunal had no jurisdiction on a contractual agreement between it and the local council and that it had no obligation to give reasons for its decisions However Mintoff stressed that “the least one expects from any public authority is to respect the principle of natural justice” and that the authority should abide to a “higher standard” of “transparency and correctness” Court also observed that had the tribunal not blocked the Lands Authority from taking back a part of the garden the land in question would have been simply released “without any reaction simply on the basis of a written request of a public authority whose function should be that of administrating public land in the interest of the common good” The Lands Authority’s decision court added was “not an act of good administration particularly when one considers that the local council is a representative organ which has to answer back to the residents it represents for any decision it objects to or approves”

More deaths expected as Malta’s climate grows warmer – study,"April 26, 2023 11:44 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A recent study has uncovered scientific evidence linking the local effect of temperatures on respiratory and circulatoryrelated mortality in Malta showing that an increase in mortality rates is expected as the climate grows warmer The study held by Maltese and Australian researchers examines the effect of temperatures on local mortality rates with a focus on respiratory and circulatoryrelated deaths The results which have been published in esteemed peerreviewed scientific journals show that currently in Malta cold temperatures are more likely to be strongly associated with mortality than high temperatures However this is expected to change as the islands’ climate grows warmer with higher average temperatures potentially tipping the balance onto higher heatmortality deaths In fact for the past few decades Malta’s mean annual ambient temperature has risen by about 15oC on average Medical statistics show a total of 7679 respiratory and 32847 circulatoryrelated deaths in Malta between 1992 and 2017 A timeseries analysis associating mortality with average daily temperatures in Malta found that there is a higher risk for coldrelated respiratory mortality compared to heatrelated effects This is also the case with circulatoryrelated deaths Compared to median average temperatures ‘extreme cold’ was strongly related to deaths for both ischaemic heart disease 85 higher risk and cerebrovascular disease 280 higher risk in cardiovascular deaths and for respiratory deaths in general 124 increase Interestingly respiratory death statistical associations were found for males across all age groups but not for females However the degree of respiratory death seems to decrease over time with a lower association of respiratory deaths to cold temperatures for the period 20102017 This may point to better household heating over time better overall healthcare services or improved building types For circulatory deaths however especially ischaemic heart disease related deaths the studies show significant associations both for cold temperatures 97 increase and hot temperatures 233 increase between 2010 and 2017 which were not present in previous timelines This may point to local changes in weather patterns becoming more extreme over time in line with warming trends in the Mediterranean region due to climate change putting vulnerable people at risk of extreme temperature effects that contribute to death The breakthrough findings of these studies have implications both for public health policy and for climaterelated adaptation in general In Malta public health authorities issue warnings to critical health sectors whenever extreme cold weather or heatwaves are forecast However there are few actions taken or policies integrated into building regulations pertaining to temperature and insulation and these are rarely enforced Additionally Malta’s climate is set to become much warmer with implications for the local population With widening income disparities with some sectors of the population being less able to afford adaptations such as heating or airconditioning systems and a rising cost of living and inflation this can lead to increasing health risks affecting the more vulnerable sectors of the population Lowerincome individuals may have little choice but to opt out of effective temperature regulation devices placing them at increased risk of negative health outcomes These studies were carried out by Jahan Shafkat and John Paul Cauchi from the Faculty of Health Queensland University of Technology in Australia Charles Galdies from the Institute of Earth Systems University of Malta Kathleen England from Malta’s Ministry for Health and by Darren Wraith also from Queensland University of Technology Australia The two studies have been published by the academic journals Elsevier’s Climate Risk Management and Springer’s Respiratory Research

"Anti-corruption activist calls on Prime Minister, Police Chief to provide him with effective protection","April 26, 2023 9:59 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Anticorruption activist and Repubblika president Robert Aquilina has called on prime minister Robert Abela and police commissioner Angelo Gafà to provide him with effective protection in a letter addressed to both on Wednesday morning Aquilina who had a police stationed outside his home until the last general election wrote to the authorities citing concerns for his family and himself concerns which have been shared by a number of police officers In a letter signed by lawyer Therese Comodini Cachia Aquilina called upon the prime minister and the police commissioner to provide him and his family members with sufficient protection to secure his ability to exercise his right to freedom of expression without fear harassment or threats Comodini Cachia observed that Aquilina is a regular contributor in Maltese newspapers and has authored “Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe” “As an activist and author his work focuses on issues related to the rule of law corruption abuse of power and impunity All these matters are of significant public interest and related activism and discussion are crucial to the democratic process” Aquilina’s activism and publications are also protected under Article 10 – the right to freedom of expression – and article 11 – the right to association of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which is enshrined in Malta’s domesticlaw as Chapter 317 The exercise of these rights even though they are not absolute freedoms places upon the State certain obligations the implementation of which appear to fall within the responsibility of Abela and Gafà as heads of Malta’s government and of the Malta Police Force respectively The European Court of Human Rights has established that the State’s obligation is not only to refrain from interfering with the effective and genuine exercise of these freedoms but also to take positive measures of protection Moreover positive obligations also require that while establishing an effective system of protection for authors or journalists States are to create a safe and enabling environment which is conducive to the participation in public debates of all those concerned allowing them to express their opinions and ideas without fear even if these go against those represented and defended by the official authorities or by a significant part of public opinion or which are irritating or shocking Comodini Cachia observed that these obligations have been reflected in several resolutions adopted by the different organs of the Council of Europe of which Malta is a member These include the Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation CMREC20164 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors and Resolution 20952016 on Strengthening the protection and role of human rights defenders in Council of Europe member States Recommendation CMREC20164 reiterates the principle that “being able to exercise the right to freedom of expression without fear implies that as a minimum the safety security and protection are guaranteed effectively in practice for everyone in particular journalists and other media actors and there is an expectation that they can contribute to public debate without fear and without having to modify their conduct due to fear” Resolution 20952016 calls on member States to ensure an enabling environment for the work of human rights defenders and for effective protection against acts of intimidation to refrain from conducting smear campaigns against them and to condemn any such campaigns conducted in the media or by other nonstate actors among other things Comodini Cachia also referred to the Caruana Galizia public inquiry report that had identified the State’s failure in recognising the combination of the hostile dehumanising and intimidating environment against Daphne Caruana Galizia targeting her for her publications on matters of corruption financial crime and impunity in a highly polarised political culture which exposed her to such risks against which the public authorities ought to have acted She observed that an intimidating and hostile environment was being created against Aquilina and said the state authorities were not making due considerations whether Aquilina and his family were deserving of protection “No one can dispute that the polarised political culture is ongoing Dr Aquilina’s work has been dismissed or disparagingly referred to in political activities at times even by persons holding public office or by persons who are close to or have the support of persons holding public office Harassment and dehumanisation of Dr Aquilina consistently takes place on media platforms including social media seeking to isolate him and to portray him as the enemy or the traitor of government” Comodini Cachia said Comodini Cachia also made cited the specific threats being made against Aquilina some of which have been reported to the police These have been either determined or are still pending before the courts “While the prosecution of those persons who are directly reported by Dr Aquilina for making threats against him is positive it appears that the context which has often given rise to these attacks is not considered sufficient for him and his family to be provided with protection” Aquilina and his family had also been targeted in threatening letters He was also targeted in a threatening message verbally sent to him by a person who is not of Maltese nationality that they would see to Aquilina themselves after a third person refused to inform him that he should back down The anticorruption activist was also threatened by a police officer who during interrogation chose to remain silent and then went on to resign from the force Such threats have not been considered as sufficient for Aquilina and his family to be provided with protection “It seems that the authorities would only be willing to protect Dr Aquilina when there is clear evidence of a real and immediate risk of a specific attack on his life This effectively means that the authorities would only be willing to protect Dr Aquilina only when the knife is already metaphorically at his throat” The lawyer highlighted that the authorities are disregarding the political context and the organised crime against which his activism and publications strive thereby underestimating their obligations in providing such protection as is needed for him to exercise his freedom of expression without fear threats and harassment as required by law
Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over hospitals concession deal – NAO,"May 15, 2023 5:41 PM",Former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval a damning NAO audit shows The new audit report states that Mizzi acted in “haste” and the transfer was authorised “unilaterally” without “the appropriate sanction” by the Cabinet of ministers The requests by VGH were only discussed in Cabinet on 9 January 2018 “days after the approvals” by the then tourism minister had already been granted the report says After racking up €36 million in debts VGH then agreed to transfer the contract to Steward Healthcare for a reported €1 The report also belies disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s claims that all decisions taken on the hospitals deal were taken by his Cabinet of ministers Speaking in the aftermath of the court judgment that annulled the concession agreement in February Muscat had claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and collective decisions by the Cabinet Mizzi is also accused of having misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” “The delegation of responsibility for a health concession to the Minister for Tourism was deemed illogical by the NAO and provided a convenient opportunity for the exploitation of Government creating weakness where there ought to have been none a weakness all to readily leveraged by the SHC” “The most evident exploitation was that secured by the SHC in terms of Government’s liability to pay €100000000 and the sum of the lenders’ debt to the Concessionaire in case of courtdeclared nullity of the concession agreements irrespective of the party attributed the default a situation precipitated by the Minister for Tourism and engineered through his misleading of Cabinet Compounding matters was that Cabinet’s authorisation was not sought by the Minister for Tourism in instances when Government acted as guarantor in several financing agreements entered into by the SHC and the BOV” In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months This came after former PN leader Adrian Delia opened a court case in 2018 in a bid to force the cancellation of the 99year emphyteutical concession agreement on the basis that the original concessionaire VGH and their heirs in title Steward Healthcare had not fulfilled their contractual obligations Depasquale had harsh words for all parties involved in the deal including government concessionaires VGH and Steward Healthcare and in a scathing sentence said government had failed to protect the national interest in the privatisation deal In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement” Defying all logic the judge said Mizzi granted VGH another three years automatically extendable for another year and a half that is four and a half years in total ie until the end of the year 2022 to do what they had failed to do by September 2018 The judge also pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back The latest report was tabled in parliament on Monday afternoon Government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament holds an urgent debate on the report published by the NAO But the Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO’s findings Moreover the National Audit Office expressed great concern that Mizzi refused to collaborate during the probe “It is with the gravest concern that the NAO views the failure of the Minister for Tourism to cooperate in this audit as inexcusable compounded no less by the centrality of his role in the concession The shirking of accountability on the part of the Minister for Tourism hampered this Office in its understanding of the initial developments that led to the concession being taken over by the SHC and impacted other aspects for which he assumed responsibility in relation thereto most notably in authorising the change of control and in representing Government as guarantor for funds secured by the SHC” In addition the NAO said it could not verify assertions made by others regarding the role played by Mizzi in this concession “The NAO holds a bleak view of the Minister for Tourism’s conduct in this respect for ministers of Government and public officials who have acted in the interests of the Government should find no difficulty in accounting for their decisions and actions The action on the part of the Minister for Tourism in not cooperating with the NAO was deemed deplorable”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"Murder suspect, Yorgen Fenech, takes repeated bail refusal to Strasbourg Court","April 26, 2023 9:28 AM",Murder suspect Yorgen Fenech who has been indicted over his role in the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights after being repeatedly denied bail His legal team claimed that the authorities’ repeated refusals have become more generic repetitive and stereotyped Fenech has filed a total of 15 bail applications – all of which have been refused The former Electrogas director had first filed for bail in December 2019 – a month after his arraignment The request was denied with the court citing concerns over tampering of evidence and disturbance of public order He filed a further eight bail applications which were refused by the courts as Fenech’s lawyers argued for his release from pretrial custody Fenech’s lawyers eventually filed a case before the First Hall Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction in May 2021 The lawyers argued that the repeated denial of bail breached his fundamental rights The application was rejected due to concerns that he would abscond given that he was on his yacht on his way to Sicily during his arrest A bill of indictment was issued in August of the same year and the case moved to the pretrial stage before the Criminal Court However his lawyers argue that his “protracted detention” breaches his right to trial within a reasonable time or otherwise release pending trial in terms of Article 53 of the European Convention of Human Rights His legal team argued that the courts’ reasons for rejecting his bail applications were “identical” to those mentioned in the most recent pronouncement last December They accuse the courts of manifesting a “persistent reluctance” to accept the prosecution’s objections to Fenech’s bail requests without verifying whether the underlying reasons were true The lawyers – Marion Camilleri Gianluca Caruana Curran and Charles Mercieca – cited a ruling by the Strasbourg Court in the Meinrad Calleja case where it had held that Calleja’s fundamental rights were breached due to the time he spent in preventive custody while awaiting trial for his alleged involvement in the attempted murder of the then prime minister’s personal assistant
Mayor warns tribalism is scaring people away from local politics,"April 26, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Xagħra mayor Christian Zammit called for an electoral reform which would facilitate the election of independent candidates on local councils as he argued against the partisanship which has engulfed local politics Speaking on the discussion programme Għawdex Jitkellem on 103 Malta’s Heart Zammit said that the strong presence of the two main parties and the accompanying tribalism discouraged people from running for local elections The Labour mayor went on to predict that in next year’s local elections the two mainstream parties will find it hard to attract valid people to run for local councils because they fear a barrage of attacks insults and threats On his part the president of the Gozo Regional Council Samuel Azzopardi called on Labour and PN to be bold and decentralise more powers and pass them on to local councils Weighing in on the matter Nadur mayor Edward Said said that councils should be given more powers and resources to serve citizens better Said who has been mayor for nine years added that councils were and remain relevant because people have always sought their services Zammit was in agreement adding that councils exist to serve citizens as he dismissed the notion that people run for council elections for financial reasons given that many people are surprised at the poor remuneration councillors receive Azzopardi said that even though not much has changed over the years in legal terms local councils have lost certain powers as society itself evolved He added that the creation of new authorities and agencies had created new conflicts which effectively sidelined councils who are hardly consulted Agreeing that councils have been rendered powerless in many aspects Zammit recalled how an Italian mayor wears a tshirt saying ‘It’s always the mayor’s fault’ However unlike Italy Zammit said that local councils in Malta are badly funded and have little authority He explained that the Xagħra council which represents a population of 5200 rakes in some €600000 a year of which some €250000 goes to waste collection and workers’ wages Zammit asked how councils are expected to build a road of half a kilometre that would cost a million euros from these funds Charging against excessive bureaucracy Azzopardi said that whenever central government allocated more funds to local councils this yielded better results as councillors and mayors often do most of the work themselves This inefficiency Azzopardi added meant that government spends 150 more when it invests money directly into projects instead of channeling the funds to councils Said explained that at times councils refrain from applying for funding because they lack the necessary capital to fork out a percentage of the total cost Touching on the svtentive sue of development and planning in Gozo Azzopardi said councils do not object to development but to the rampant speculation which was having a negative impact on the environment Insisting that such opposition reflected the general feeling among citizens Azzopardi said the funds that councils can use to object to development permits is €70000 and a local council can use up to a maximum of €5000

Opposition proposes food waste law,"May 15, 2023 4:30 PM",The Opposition presented a private members’ bill aimed at fighting food waste and loss on Monday morning The proposed law comes as Malta is the only EU country that does not have a national plan on food waste Nationalist MP Ivan Bartolo said the bill is intended to reduce food waste at every stage from its production to processing distribution and handling Noting that over 20 of the population was at risk of poverty and social exclusion the MP said official figures show that each person generates some 135 kilograms of food waste every year In order to address the situation Bartolo said Malta needs to take immediate action to ensure that food – an essential resource for a healthy society and sustainable living – is distributed with the least possible waste adding that no citizen should be deprived of this basic right because of their social or financial situation The Opposition’s proposed law provides that the Malta Food Agency shall seek to reduce food waste at every stage of production processing distribution and handling by “a encouraging the recovery and donation of excess food for the purpose of social solidarity among humans “b by curbing the negative impacts on the environment and the natural resources by carrying out actions that reduce food wastage and the generation of waste from food “c by promoting the reuse and recycling of food with the aim of lengthening sic the life cycle of food and “d by promoting research and the knowledge of information among consumers on all matters that are necessary to reduce food wastage and the generation of waste from food” Nationalist parliamentary group whip Robert Cutajar MP Toni Bezzina accompanied Bartolo as he presented the private members’ bill to Speaker Anġlu Farrugia Prime Minister Robert Abela’s has come under fire from antipoverty campaigners for refusing to “impose” legislation on supermarkets Last year antipoverty campaigner Matthew Borg had told the Andrew Azzopardi talkshow on 103 Malta’s Heart that “guaranteeing access to food to everyone should not depend on charity… but it should be written in law” A 2017 European Commission report entitled ‘Redistribution of Surplus Food’ exposed Malta’s failure to tackle the issue and was the only country to have no plan Borg had said
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Man sues for damages after court case dragged on for 18 years,"April 25, 2023 10:00 AM",A man is suing the Maltese State for compensation over a breach of his fundamental right to a fair hearing after court proceedings took over 18 years to come to an end Lawyers Franco Debono and Marion Camilleri filed a court application on behalf of Nazzareno Dalli who was arrested in September 2004 and charged with a series of thefts from fuel service stations fraud and the circulation of fake currency However following a series of delays the case was only decided in March 2023 with the court finding the man not guilty of the charged brought against him Claiming that the the delays had effectively put his life on hold for almost 20 years Dalli is requesting the state to pay him damages given that the delays breached his right to a fair hearing in a reasonable time In his application Dalli claimed that the duration of the court case was in breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time as established by the European Convention on Human Rights Article 6 of the convention stipulates that “in the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law” However Dalli saw his case put off 29 times since 2013 at the request of the prosecution with the only evidence produced being the testimony by the prosecuting officer Moreover the man held that he was not responsible for any of the delays as he had only failed to attend one sitting because he was ill and had provided court with a medical certificate The application filed against the police commissioner the attorney general and the state advocate states that the delays in the case cannot be justified in any way and the plaintiff cannot be held responsible for the delays In November 2013 the case was adjourned indefinitely sine die and only resumed in October 2022 before a new magistrate The case was initially led by former assistant commissioner Ian Abdilla who at the time was a police inspector In 2021 Abdilla was suspended from the Police Force over his inaction in the Panama Papers investigation and since then he started working as a tour guide Dalli was charged with forging banknotes possession and use of Maltese counterfeit money fraud theft of diesel and petrol as well as handling stolen goods After pleading not guilty the prosecution declared that they had only one other witness to produce other than Abdilla but the person did not wish to testify since he too was undergoing criminal proceedings Earlier this year the defence requested the court to declare the statement released by the accused in 2004 without any legal assistance to be inadmissible in evidence against him and in his sentence Magistrate Victor George Axiak followed a line of established caselaw which declared inadmissible statements made by a suspect without legal assistance prior to February 2010 when Maltese law did not yet grant such right to the accused in the prearraignment stage When delivering judgment the magistrate observed that this was “another classic example of unnecessarily draggedout proceedings” when the prosecution had only produced one witness in almost 20 years namely the prosecutor himself

"1 dead, 20 reported missing in Maltese SAR","April 24, 2023 8:36 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti At least one person hoping to reach Europe has died in Malta’s searchandrescue area and over 20 people are believed to be missing as dozens of groups departed from Tunisia in a bid to reach Lampedusa overnight Italy’s Guardia Costiera has reported The Italian coastguard said that it had assisted no less than 1200 people who set off from Tunisia on 35 boats all have been disembarked at Lampedusa which lies 113km away from Tunisia and is thus the closest EU landmass to Africa in the central Mediterranean But while most interventions took place without incident the Guardia Costiera reported that 3 of the boats had shipwrecked en route with casualties feared in all three cases The first shipwreck took place in Italy’s SAR some 20 nautical miles away from Lampedusa and 3 people are reported missing but the other two shipwrecks took place in Malta’s own SAR The survivors who were rescued from the second shipwreck reported that some 20 people were unaccounted for The dead body of one of the people on board the third wrecked boat was recovered by the coastguard everyone else on board is believed to have been rescued The Guardia Costiera reported that the operation was overseen by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and involved its own aerial and naval assets as well as those of the Guardia di Finanza of Frontex and of a rescue NGO It also said that it was aware of 20 other boats still at sea
Police frisk and question activist who puts up Jean Paul Sofia banner,"April 24, 2023 7:57 PM",A young man who put up a banner calling for “Justice for Jean Paul Sofia” in front of Parliament House was accosted by police frisked and taken to a station for questioning for his efforts The youth was later released without charge but the heavyhanded response to an obvious gesture of protest has drawn a number of condemnations from various activists and Nationalist Party MPs The activist is part of a group of “Friends of Jean Paul Sofia” who have been supporting the family of the 20yearold who was killed in a construction site last December in their call for an independent public inquiry into his death This public inquiry is being forcefully opposed by the government with prime minister Robert Abela going as far as to suggest to Sofia’s mother Isabelle Bonnici that she was being manipulated for partisan political purposes in an exchange between the two last week The same friends had restored a portrait of Sofia that Bonnici had placed outside the Auberge de Castille earlier this month which had been quickly removed an action for which no public authority has yet claimed responsibility ‘False report’ leads to police response In statements to various media the Malta Police Force justified its response on the basis of a report it received purportedly concerning a man donning a balaclava and acting suspiciously Though the youth was wearing a hoodie he was wearing no balaclava Why the police officers concerned failed to draw the seeminglyobvious conclusion that a person hanging a banner calling for justice was engaging in a peaceful act of protest – rather than something sinister – remained unexplained Instead they drew the conclusion that the youth should be searched and escorted to a police station for questioning where PN MP and lawyer Karol Aquilina assisted the youth who was soon released without charge The banner also remains in place but the police response drew withering criticism from within and outside of Parliament “We’ve seen this before It is chilling to witness the behaviour of a government which knows they are responsible for the death of an innocent person They rush to cover up the evidence Then they rush to silence anyone who dares ask questions Everyone should see that without meaning to anyone can find themselves an inconvenience suppressed by the government” Repubblika said “This could happen to you” In Parliament Grech contrasted the police’s readiness to respond to an act of protest outside of Parliament with their clear reluctance to act when faced with the abusive behaviour of many powerful individuals in the construction industry The police are also yet to arraign anyone over Sofia’s death though Abela has focused his criticism solely on the inquiring magistrate MP Eve Borg Bonello took to social media to argue that the police’s response was more befitting of an authoritarian country as she expressed solidarity with the activist “We arrest innocent people who protect peacefully as they do in North Korea” she said PN MP and former party leader Adrian Delia also took to social media to express his concerns insisting that the authorities “should be ashamed” for their response “The prime minister doesn’t want a public inquiry on the death of Jean Paul Sofia and then a youth hanging a banner calling for justice is arrested” he observed The issue was also raised in Parliament by MP Jerome Caruana Cilia who criticised the police’s response to what proved to be a “false report” Their actions he insisted were an obvious overreaction
Mother cleared of harassment over texts urging ex to pay for daughter’s treatment,"April 24, 2023 7:23 PM",An appeals court overturned a 26yearold woman’s conviction on harassment charges over a series of texts she sent to her ex in which she asked repeatedly for money to pay for dental work their daughter needed The messages which led to criminal charges being filed against the woman were sent to the father between March and April 2020 and the father appears to have filed a police report after one of the messages labelled him a “clown” purċinell among other lessthanflattering descriptions She was charged with the misuse of electronic communications equipment and with various counts of harassment While the following October she was acquitted of the former she was convicted of harassment prompting her to file an appeal through her lawyer Jason Grima In his ruling Judge Neville Camilleri observed that the troubles between the two parents began when the woman accused the father of shirking his duties and failing to pay child support The man confirmed that he had stopped paying child support but said that he did so because he was being denied access to his daughter The woman said that she sent the insulting messages after her ex’s new partner got involved the man confirmed that his partner had replied to one of the mother’s messages She argued that this suggested that he was not free to make his own decisions hence her choice of words She said that her primary concern was to get the father to fund the dental treatment their daughter needed because she was in pain which she could not afford because she was unemployed The daughter was eventually treated for free at a state hospital In this context – and after examining the content of the messages themselves – Judge Camilleri concluded that they did not constitute harassment but were a plea for help It was not harassment he emphasised for a mother to ask the father for money when their daughter needed treatment Consequently the judge upheld the appeal and cleared the woman of any wrongdoing
Police fail to act on construction abuses because offenders are ‘protected’ – Grech,"April 24, 2023 6:40 PM",Nationalist Party leader suggested that the worst lawbreakers in the construction industry were facing no repercussions because someone – potentially within the government – was protecting them as he took aim at what he described as a “culture of impunity” in the industry on Monday Grech was speaking during debate on a bill amending various laws on construction including to pave the way for the licensing of various professions involved As minister Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi explained as he introduced the bill while masons have required a licence since the 19th century no further licensing requirements have yet been introduced – and none cover excavation or demolition works despite the clear dangers involved While the PN leader confirmed that the opposition would be voting in favour of a bill which he described as a small step in the right direction – whilst pledging to submit suggestions to improve the bill in committee – he described himself as less than impressed by the minister’s introduction for one key reason a failure to make any mention of “those who are negatively affected by abusive construction” The industry’s victims he emphasised did not just include those who were killed by its abuses – not least Miriam Pace and Jean Paul Sofia – but also the countless individuals who lived or worked in or near construction sites where regulations were often openly flouted Many he said had to pursue expensive court action because the authorities repeatedly failed to respond to any reports being made “When you make a report because your house is trembling and no one comes you feel that the government pays no attention to your plight” he observed And Grech emphasised that any present or future laws are useless unless they are properly enforced The PN leader also took aim at what he described as the government’s decision to politicise the support the opposition was offering to the family of Jean Paul Sofia as it called for a public inquiry into the youth’s death “You must have a heart of stone not to feel for his mother as a Maltese citizen as a human being” he said pledging to continue supporting the family “because it is the right thing to do no less and no more” But months on the police kept on doing nothing in the face of the industry’s abuses even if it responded with surprising speed to stop a young man who hung a banner calling for “justice for Jean Paul Sofia” outside of Parliament The youth was released without charge and the banner was not removed the police later told media that they responded to a report of a hooded man acting suspiciously “When it comes to those who flout every construction regulation who are endangering your life and robbing you of serenity… they are allowed to do as they please” he said “The police do nothing to them likely because someone on the other side of this chamber is protecting them and where this isn’t the case because the system developed by the government has fostered impunity” As he brought his address to a close he reiterated that strengthening Malta’s laws and structures was always a positive step “But let us not have any doubt that someone failed to do their duty – and someone in here continues to defend them” he concluded
Minister insists commenting on Air Malta at this stage would be ‘irresponsible’,"April 24, 2023 5:52 PM",Finance minister Clyde Caruana reiterated on Monday that he was not yet in a position to discuss the plight of Air Malta – as much as he would want to A parliamentary sitting on Tuesday had seen opposition MPs walk out of the chamber following speaker Anġlu Farrugia’s refusal to accept a request to hold an urgent debate on the airline after its executive chair David Curmi confirmed in an interview that Air Malta was set to be shut down at the end of the year and replaced with a new national airline In contrast to Curmi who said that the negotiations on possible state aid with the European Commission had all but failed Caruana insisted that he could not say anything until these complex discussions were brought to a close The minister stuck to his guns during question time on Monday as he faced questions by PN MPs Ivan J Bartolo Mario de Marco and Ivan Castillo though the atmosphere was far less contentious The PN MPs repeatedly said that they could understand the minister’s position with Caruana in turn stating that he could appreciate the strong public interest in the matter Following an initial and perhaps predictably futile question by Bartolo de Marco emphasised that the questions being made followed Curmi’s own public statements and attempted to get Caruana to react to the executive chair’s statements Caruana however chose not to do so The minister did respond to another of de Marco’s queries concerning any of the airilne’s debts that could be taken up by the government Caruana insisted that the government’s efforts to reduce its deficit would not be derailed highlighting that it was already revising its projected deficit for this year from 55 of the GDP to 5 But he once more repeated that he could not answer every question even as he emphasised his eagerness to do so “This saga has now dragged on for years and cost the country a lot of money” he said “I want to explain how things are as much as you want me to if not more” Later in the proceedings Bartolo asked when the minister believed he would be in a position to explain what was happening Caruana could not give a specific timeline but highlighted that the government expects to be able to submit answers to the Commission’s pending questions on the matter by next week Assuming no further questions are made by the Commission that could see negotiations conclude in relatively short order “Until then I would be irresponsible to give answers according to what I know because this answer may change one way or another and I must be certain that everything is settled with the Commission” he said

Archbishop asks Malta’s Indian community for forgiveness for disrespect they may face,"April 24, 2023 4:31 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Archbishop Charles Scicluna asked members of Malta’s Indian community for forgiveness for each occasion in which they encountered Maltese Christians who did not treat them with the dignity respect love and compassion they deserved The Archbishop was speaking during a retreat which was organised for Malta’s SyroMalabar Catholics which are part of the ancient ethnoreligious community of St Thomas Christians hailing from the southern Indian state of Kerala As this name suggests the community traces its origins to the missionary activities of Thomas the Apostle Emigration has seen the establishment of SyroMalabar communities across the globe and Malta is no exception to the rule masses – or qurbanas as they are known to St Thomas Christians – are now celebrated every Sunday in multiple localities around Malta held in their native Malayalam and following the SyroMalabar Rite “In the name of the Church in Malta I would like to say to each one of you you are welcome Thank you for being here among us with a witness of a huge sense of duty dedication to work and family but also a great witness to faith” the Archbishop said at the beginning of his address He recalled that many parish priests spoke fondly about the Indian Christians who found time to visit churches to pray and who “bear witness to a faith that is devout heartwarming and sincere” But the Archbishop nevertheless recognised that warm welcome that the Church in Malta wished to extend to Malta’s Indian Christians was not always necessarily echoed by the Maltese “You have come to know our society which has its benefits but also its deficits Sometimes we say that we are a welcoming society but you know at times you don’t feel as welcome as you should be” he said “So I would like to ask you forgiveness for every time that you meet a Maltese Christian and you don’t feel treated with dignity with respect with love and compassion” As he did so he also thanked the community for its dedicated service in many walks of life describing their contribution to society as one that was essential and that was set to become more important in the coming years The Archbishop urged the community – which he noted belonged “to a very ancient truth of faith and fidelity” – to never forget its roots and to be proud of its heritage “Be convinced that you have something beautiful you can share with us and pray that we natives of these islands are humble enough and wise enough to understand that through respect and communion we are not poorer but richer” he said Mgr Scicluna then asked community for its intercession urging it to pray “that we remain what Paul the apostle found in AD 60 a community of men and women who had huge hearts and saw people needing help and they did not shy away from lending a helping hand” a safe haven for everyone and a community that cherishes family life He urged the community to pray so that the young living in Malta may feel accepted wherever they may come from and asked for a special prayer that Malta “may always remain safe for babies in their mother’s womb” as he once more thanked the members of the community who worked in the care professions And as he concluded his address the Archbishop said that his last prayer was that “you may be always friends of each other and willing to support each other” not least since the immigrant experience involved living far from home far from one’s loved ones and far from the places and memories of childhood “We all carry these in our hearts but we need support It is good to be connected digitally We live in a wonderful world where we are always connected but we also need the physical tenderness of true friendship of true love and loyalty And as you gather today to listen to the Word of God to celebrate the Eucharist to receive the sacrament of reconciliation and Holy Communion may the Lord fill you with his peace with his joy and with his comfort May the Lord bless you always” he concluded

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

“My Facebook post was aimed at explaining how money laundering works”,"April 24, 2023 2:28 PM",Journalist Matthew Caruana Galizia told a court that a post published on his social media account was intended to explain money laundering investigations how money laundering works in practice the role of offshore companies and the risks associated with opaque structures and lack of transparency Caruana Galizia was testifying in libel proceedings instituted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat The latter had filed the case against Daphne Caruana Galizia over a story published just months before her murder alleging that the secret Panama company Egrant belonged to Muscat’s wife Michelle Caruana Galizia had based her story largely on information she received from Maria Efimova a former Pilatus Bank official An inquiry by then magistrate Aaron Bugeja later concluded that Egrant was not owned by the former Prime Minister’s family and ordered criminal proceedings against Efimova for calumny Muscat also filed separate libel suits against the victim’s son Matthew over a Facebook post he had uploaded as well as against Karl Gouder and Mario Frendo former NET TV editor and journalist respectively over news reports concerning the Egrant saga Taking the witness stand on Monday afternoon Caruana Galizia explained that his post was a hypothetical case intended to offer an explanation on money laundering investigations how money laundering works in practice The post also served as an explainer into the workings of opaque structures and highlighted the risks associated with having politicians being involved in high risk sectors “Without transparency we stand a great risk of having politicians being involved in organised crime and corruption” Caruana Galizia said The court asked the witness whether he had discussed the outcome of the Egrant magisterial inquiry with his mother “A journalistic investigation is extremely different from one conducted by a magistrate” Caruana Galizia started by saying and added “a magistrate has more resources at their disposal when compared to journalists They can also order evidence to be seized while journalists depend on their sources and what they are able to get out from conversations” He then explained that the scope of the inquest was “extremely narrow” and this had been discussed with his mother In the case of the Egrant inquiry the third Panamanian company on which a magisterial inquiry had been initiated following a formal complaint by Muscat through his lawyer Pawlu Lia and Edward Gatt Lia laid down the terms of reference asking two questions 1 Is there any evidence that the shares in Egrant a Panamanian company established in 2013 using Mossack Fonseca and Nexia BT services owned by Michelle Muscat or are otherwise attributable to her or her husband the Prime Minister and 2 Is there any evidence that the Prime Minister and wife Keith Schembri Konrad Mizzi or John Dalli engaged in any illicit dealings through bank accounts at Pilatus Bank with Politically Exposed Persons PEPs from Azerbaijan Referring to information in the public domain Caruana Galizia said “Pilatus Bank had a lot of unusual activity and there was a high probability of illegalities going on The bank has been described to me as a laundromat” He then referred to the terms of reference and said in journalistic investigations journalists do not look at one single offshore company but would look at a network of offshore companies and associated bank accounts “When people are trying to launder money or obscure its origins they tend to use more than one company bank or frontman Investigating such a network requires a huge effort A single judicial investigator or police would struggle with such an investigator let alone a single journalist” Magistrate Victor Axiak referred to Caruana Galizia’s Facebook post and asked whether it was a generic example or specific facts concerning Muscat disgraced former minister Konrad Mizzi and former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri “In any investigation you do not pull anything out of thin air” Caruana Galizia said he then explained that officials accountants and lawyers arranged a corporate setup only intended or could be intended to obscure the origin of funds “Brian Tonna had a company in Malta that was acting for the sale of passports and visas and a company in the British Virgin Islands billing the Maltese company for services Essentially Brian Tonna billing Brian Tonna Why would he do this” He added that it would impossible to get any information from the authorities in the British Virgin Islands and local tax authorities only got to know about these offshore structures following the Panama Papers leak Caruana Galizia explained that he would usually know about his mother’s investigation after she publishes it “Her sources especially during her last year’s of life where high level officials who would contact her” he said “I didn’t have any interaction with sources or evidence What I would know is from what I observe and sometimes I would assist her in minor work” “Her sense of ethics was very strong She would not publish anything without solid evidence She had a strong sense of ethics” Caruana Galizia said and added that what he learnt about journalism was from her It was only in 2016 that Daphne Caruana Galizia asked him a direct question on Macbridge and 17 Black Asked if he could defend himself in his mother’s case which he inherited Caruana Galizia said “It is almost impossible for me to defend myself in my mother’s case unless I am in church and a box with evidence falls from heaven” He added that they are suffering a prejudice because he did not know what his mother knew saw and what went on through her mind “We need a miracle or my mother to come back to life to be freed from this prejudice” The case was adjourned to 19 June at noon Lawyer Pawlu Lia assisted Muscat Lawyers Peter Caruana Galizia and Joe Zammit Maempel assisted the respondents

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul

Occupy Justice demands reopening of Egrant inquiry,"May 17, 2023 9:39 AM",Activists from Occupy Justice staged a protest outside Castille on Tuesday evening calling for the Egrant inquiry to be reopened “The reopening of the Egrant Inquiry is long overdue You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves for ignoring this History will not be kind to you for betraying those you were duty bound to serve and protect  Take action or resign” the activists warned Robert Abela’s administration In September 2021 Magistrate Ian Farrugia called for the reopening of Egrant inquiry  However to date the Attorney General has failed to take any action In spite of recent revelations regarding the Egrant Inquiry and all the dirty manoeuvres by Pilatus Bank officials and employees Occupy Justice said “there hasn’t been so much as a peep of action from the Floriana Police Depot or the Attorney General’s office” The magisterial inquiry into Pilatus Bank ordered that the Egrant inquiry be reopened after finding reasonable suspicion that 11 million were transferred from Azerbaijan to an account at Pilatus Bank through a parallel and secretive accounting system Murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had claimed that Egrant was owned by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s wife Michelle and the company received a payment of US1017 from Leyla Aliyeva daughter of Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev The Muscats vehemently deny these allegations An inquiry ordered by Muscat had found no evidence linking him and his wife to the secret Panama company but the owner remains unknown to this day “Whilst they’re dragging their feet and coming up with excuses to justify their inaction making sure that justice is delayed criminals roam free and are gifted years of a headstart to cover their tracks It seems that our institutions are spinelessly hell bent in protecting fraudsters and corrupt individuals instead of investigating them” Occupy Justice said Reminding finance minister Clyde Caruana that on 1 November 2019 he pledged to make available all necessary resources should there be ‘a request’ to reopen the Egrant Inquiry Occupy Justice said “that request was made by Magistrate Ian Farrugia who called for it to be reopened The Attorney General was legally obliged to comply with Magistrate Farrugia’s order Instead this was ignored – not that we’ve come to expect better from this office” “Well here we are making the request again We’re also demanding that this time round the terms for the Inquiry are not drafted by the prime suspect in the case It is laughable that this happened in the first place” They added that the contempt with which the Labour administration has treated the Maltese people for these past ten years is unprecedented “using its privilege and power to shield those who should have faced justice years ago All this makes us wonder as to who is really pulling the strings”
Appeals court convicts men who illegally detained journalists at Castille in 2019,"May 16, 2023 10:09 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected After that press conference at around 3am on 29 November three men who refused to identify themselves but who appeared to act as plainclothes security guards kept the journalists from leaving the building The trio were subsequently identified as Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay and charged with illegally detaining four journalists – Agius Xuereb Paul Caruana Galizia and Julian Bonnici While more journalists were present – as footage of the incident showed – their version of events was never sought The case did not appear to have been treated with any urgency by the police a police report was filed on 2 December 2019 by Agius and Xuereb with the former presenting footage she filmed on her phone as evidence and charges were issued on 14 July Despite this delay Magistrate Joe Mifsud had found the police investigation to be lacking and in his acquittal of the three men he argued that his hands were tied by the charge – and evidence – presented by the prosecution In his view the evidence was not sufficient to prove the charge to the level required by the court But the Office of the Attorney General ended up filing an appeal in which it insisted that Magistrate Mifsud drew his conclusion on the basis of an erroneous application of the law Lawyer Etienne Savona had highlighted that the defendants were clearly impeding access to the door journalists had used to enter Castille and that such behaviour gave the journalists the impression that a physical confrontation would emerge if they persisted in their attempts to leave the building Ultimately Judge Aaron Bugeja upheld the AG’s appeal overturning the acquittal and finding the three men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest The judge opted to conditionally discharge the trio for 6 months giving them the standard warning that committing another offence in this period would also see them punished for the illegal arrest they carried out at the Office of the Prime Minister

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"Repubblika demands arrest of Muscat, Mizzi to prevent them from fleeing","May 16, 2023 3:07 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Repubblika asked the magistrate conducting an inquiry into the hospitals privatisation deal with Vitals Global Healthcare to take note of the damning Auditor General report on the concession and if necessary order the immediate arrest of people who are preparing to abscond In comments to Newsbookcommt Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said “we asked the inquiring magistrate to tale all the necessary action to prevent anyone involved in the ruse from fleeing the country” He added that court must order the arrest of anyone who could be preparing to abscond as he named former disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and former Labour ministers Konrad Mizzi and Chris Cardona The NGO also asked the magistrate to grant immunity to whoever was involved in the deal and is prepared to reveal their accomplices The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In a press conference outside the Valletta courthouse on Tuesday afternoon Aquilina underlined a number of findings in the NAO report including the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” between Muscat and Mizzi Among others Aquilina said the NAO report found that Muscat and Mizzi’s actions hindered health minister Chris Fearne’s ability to negotiate with Steward Healthcare SHC “The reluctance of the Minister for Tourism to step back from interactions with the SHC was detrimental to the Government’s interests for it created a weakness in its position all to evident to the SHC a weakness that – based on that noted by the Minister for Health – was readily exploited” the NAO said Aquilina also pointed out that Muscat and Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers over the agreement that saw government act as guarantor of Steward Healthcare’s loan from Bank of Valletta While noting the “complicity” between former prime minister Joseph Muscat and Mizzi to mislead the Cabinet of ministers Repubblika asked the inquiring magistrate to order the Attorney General to issue an exemption from prosecution under the Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act for persons involved in the deal who are willing to reveal their accomplices Aquilina explained that former VGH director Ram Tumuluri had wanted to spill the beans on the secret deal adding that the report concluded that Tumuluri had been pressured in to transferring his shares to Steward The application filed this morning by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asked the magistrate to prevent further destruction of the evidence and prevent the suspects from leaving the island with Aquilina saying that Repubblika was informed that preparations to abscond were already underway Describing the concession as an “obscene ruse” Aquilina said the NAO report also highlights the involvement of Muscat’s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi’s then permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi The NAO report Aquilina added states that Muscat and Mizzi’s ploy to mislead the Cabinet of ministers would not have been possible without Ronald Mizzi’s involvement In 2019 Repubblika had filed an application demanding a criminal probe into the VGH deal after the Criminal Court had quashed an order to hold a magisterial inquiry placing disgraced former ministers Konrad Mizzi Edward Scicluna and Chris Cardona under magisterial scrutiny Cardona had signed a memorandum of understanding with VGH in October 2014 months before a request for proposals was even issued for the concession to operate three of Malta’s state hospitals Repubblika had demanded a criminal probe to establish if there was criminal complicity by three ministers in the controversial contract which was then annulled by court in February 2023 In their application the activists had accused the three ministers of facilitating a “coordinated” “act of modernday piracy” “corruption and money laundering among other crimes” which saw VGH’s investor leave a debt of €50 million

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Air Malta ‘a prime example of how clientelism is king in Maltese politics’ – ADPD,"April 22, 2023 2:09 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The situation at Air Malta is a prime example of how clientelism is king in Maltese politics ADPD chairperson Carmel Cacopardo said on Saturday morning Addressing a press conference outside parliament Cacopado said this was a direct consequence of a parliament totally dominated by two political parties “They have consistently joined forces to resist electoral reform because they know that a pluralist parliament will mean an end to their nepotistic and clientelist politics” he said The party’s secretary general Ralph Cassar slammed the government’s attitude towards the national airline as another consequence of the “PLPN system” Cassar noted that the airline’s restructuring has been on the cards for decades but the major political parties – the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party – had been milking the cow dry “The Air Malta problem is what it is because of years on years of political clientelism In fact Air Malta has been plagued by this nepotistic and clientelist political interference since its inception PLPN have milked Air Malta dry It was their cashcow in their respective bids to cling to power We are all victims of these shameful PLPN practices because our public funds and taxes have been used to buy votes through the Air Malta ‘cow’” Cacopardo also slammed the Labour Party for using politics as a game in which empty promises may be made in order to buy votes He noted that it was well known that the Labourled administration had been preparing for possibly winding up the national airline and recalled that on the eve of the March 2022 election Air Malta’s employees were given the assurance that the company would continue to operate They were also told any excess labour would be transferred to the public sector subject to the same salary and conditions ADPD referred to PL’s manifesto where the party had pledged that it had kicked off a process to ensure that Air Malta will remain in operation and serve its strategic objectives in line with EU regulations “It is evident this was all a charade and a load of empty promises” “This is a result of political clientelism that has been practiced without any restraint since the setting up of Air Malta Successive strategic plans failed because there had not been the political will for Air Malta to operate without political interference Millions of Euros in ‘aid’ have been squandered which effectively financed the clientelism that has led to Air Malta’s downfall” Cacopardo said

"“Pigs and criminals have Abela, the vulnerable have PN” – Grech","April 22, 2023 11:33 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “Pigs thieves criminals and fraudsters have prime minister Robert Abela while the weak sick and ordinary people have the Nationalist Party” PN leader Bernard Grech said on Saturday morning In an interview on NET FM the PN leader spoke about how the Labour Party in power abandoned the working class in favour of “fraudsters and criminals” and highlighted that taxpayers’ money was wasted on a fraudulent contract referring to the VGHSteward Health Care deal and that the government has no money to improve the working conditions of the nurses and midwives among others Grech hit out at Abela saying that the government was out of touch with the social realities affecting the workers as the cost of living soared He observed that nurses and midwives had been in negotiations for months but health minister Chris Fearne and prime minister Robert Abela wanted to give them a financial package which would have seen the wage increase by a small amount whilst the health care workers would have been required to work longer hours “Clearly Abela did not understand what the midwives and nurses have been saying They are demanding a better quality of life They are burnt out The workload has increased but the necessary investment was not done Instead the government threw €400 million at fraudsters and criminals” Grech said Earlier this week the midwives and nurses overwhelmingly rejected the financial package proposed by the government During the Extraordinary General Conference 976 of the Nurses  Midwives voted against while 1 voted in favour 14 were invalid votes Present were 804 Nurses  Midwives “The government tried to ridicule the nurses and midwives” Grech said and added that the vote showed that they were united against the government’s proposed financial package Grech also referred to the court case by which the hospitals’ deal was annulled and said government representatives continue to avoid questions by the media He noted that Labour’s former leader and MEP Alfred Sant warned against wasting taxpayers’ money on corruption during the party’s general conference Speaking about the seemingly imminent dissolution of Air Malta Grech observed that the European Commission had agreed to a plan proposed by the then PNled administration in 2012 The Opposition leader observed that the Labour Party was elected to power in 2013 and finance minister Clyde Caruana had recently admitted that the PLled administration had abandoned the 2012 plan for the national airline Grech said Caruana had questioned past decisions by the PLled government and added that disgraced former minister Konrad Mizzi was a “barefaced liar” when he claimed that Air Malta’s future was bright The Nationalist leader noted that the government was not informing the public about the situation with stakeholders being kept in the dark about the airline’s future He insisted that the government has only itself to blame for Air Malta’s failure while the PN will continue to insist for transparency and accountability Speaking about Abela’s repeated refusal to set up a public inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia Grech asked “What is Abela hiding For whom is he covering up How can he find the courage to ignore this mother’s plea” The PN leader made it a point to note the difference between a magisterial inquiry – which serves to collect material evidence – and a public inquiry – which would look into the administrative shortcomings and put forward recommendations to avoid such tragedies “We cannot tolerate such incidents to protect the pigs in our country Too many such incidents where the most powerful get away with anything” Grech said He stressed that only the PN was protecting the vulnerable Grech also spoke about the upcoming May Day protest which the PN will hold on Triq San Luqa in Gwardamanġa between St Luke’s Hospital and the national broadcaster TVM at 4pm “Abela and his government have abandoned the workers… If you want to stand up against abuse arrogance Abela and his friends with their snouts at the trough and want a better country and future you have one choice join us” he concluded

Appeals court convicts men who illegally detained journalists at Castille in 2019,"May 16, 2023 10:09 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected After that press conference at around 3am on 29 November three men who refused to identify themselves but who appeared to act as plainclothes security guards kept the journalists from leaving the building The trio were subsequently identified as Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay and charged with illegally detaining four journalists – Agius Xuereb Paul Caruana Galizia and Julian Bonnici While more journalists were present – as footage of the incident showed – their version of events was never sought The case did not appear to have been treated with any urgency by the police a police report was filed on 2 December 2019 by Agius and Xuereb with the former presenting footage she filmed on her phone as evidence and charges were issued on 14 July Despite this delay Magistrate Joe Mifsud had found the police investigation to be lacking and in his acquittal of the three men he argued that his hands were tied by the charge – and evidence – presented by the prosecution In his view the evidence was not sufficient to prove the charge to the level required by the court But the Office of the Attorney General ended up filing an appeal in which it insisted that Magistrate Mifsud drew his conclusion on the basis of an erroneous application of the law Lawyer Etienne Savona had highlighted that the defendants were clearly impeding access to the door journalists had used to enter Castille and that such behaviour gave the journalists the impression that a physical confrontation would emerge if they persisted in their attempts to leave the building Ultimately Judge Aaron Bugeja upheld the AG’s appeal overturning the acquittal and finding the three men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest The judge opted to conditionally discharge the trio for 6 months giving them the standard warning that committing another offence in this period would also see them punished for the illegal arrest they carried out at the Office of the Prime Minister

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Police officers outraged at selective FCID allowance,"April 21, 2023 7:07 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Several police officers including high profile inspectors have taken to Facebook to voice their frustration against the selective allowance given to the money laundering section within the Financial Crimes Investigation Department A joint statement released earlier on Friday by the Malta Police Union and the Police Force Union the two unions confirmed that a special allowance would be given to officers stationed at the FCID’s money laundering section The department which has been hit with several resignations was described as “very sensitive in nature and requires highlytrained and professional officers to deal with these cases in a meticulous manner” The unions also said that this will serve as an incentive to have the “best” officers in this section and employees will be retained “to the benefit of the country” The two unions were purportedly reacting to a blog post where it was reported that a small section of the Force got a salary increase but this was kept hidden from the rest The statement was posted to their respective Facebook pages attracting a barrage of comments from several officers who questioned the motive behind the increase and asked whether the unions deem their respective section as not sensitive enough The officers range from major crime inspectors and superintendents district officers vice squad officers to gender and domestic violence crimes inspectors A superintendent called out the selective allowance and said such a measure will only serve to discriminate among officers “Working in any section comes with its own risks and each section is equally important Maybe today we need to strengthen the FCID but tomorrow we would need to strengthen the Major Crimes Unit to control Organised Crime Groups that we have around us “We’ve already been through a situation that almost destroyed the country if an organised crime group becomes strong it will be problematic I believe that the Major Crimes Unit CID Homicide and Drugs together with other units and district police are working around the clock to control these organised crime groups and stopping them from growing… As far as I know we are protecting society together and ensuring that the country is safer” The superintendent went on to mention the Special Intervention Unit highlighting that these officers risk their lives to protect others including fellow officers A police inspector from the domestic violence unit also commented beneath the statement by the MPU said “Each squad within the Force including district officers deal with sensitive cases and need specialised training For the unions to justify this allowance claiming sensitivity is an insult to all officers including your members” The inspector who was also in the terrorism squad stressed that while the investigations differ greatly the sensitivity of the cases remains the same He added that both units need highly trained police officers He further argued that together with two other officers he serves as a crisis negotiator and pointed out that there was no doubt that this was “sensitive” and one needs to be specially trained for such situations “We’ve always did this ‘gratis’ We have never asked for a monetary compensation but since such compensation is being asked for sensitive cases I’d expect us to be recognised as well” he wrote Another inspector pointed out that the unions represent their members and asked when this was discussed with them “We who also have sensitive cases how are we going to get compensated when we are obtaining better results as is confirmed by each annual report” Several sources have told this newsroom that the raise came directly from the ministry It also transpired from a comment by the POU itself that the union was not involved in discussions concerning the allowance however it quickly added that it could not go against the improvement of working conditions In a statement on Saturday shadow minister for home affairs Joe Giglio said that each police officer should get an increase in their wages irrespective of the unit where they are stationed The Nationalist Party said that it has been advocating for a long time that police officers should get better salaries Giglio also hit out at the allowance as being “discriminatory”

"Sudan war: Sudanese in Malta should be given protection, activist says","May 16, 2023 7:00 AM",Videos Miguela Xuereb Sudanese nationals in Malta should be granted some form of protection Hadia Bashir said as she urged the authorities to take action and offer these asylum seekers with some stability Bashir a former politician in Sudan sat down with Newsbookcommt to reflect on the situation in her country after intense clashes between Sudan’s military and country’s main paramilitary force erupted in midApril The clashes saw hundreds of people killed whilst thousands fled the country amid the power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime which has its roots before the 30year dictatorial rule of Omar Al Bashir was brought to an end in 2019 The Sudanese armed forces are broadly loyal to General Abdel Fattah alBurhan the country’s de facto ruler The paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces RSF are a collection of militia under the command of a former warlord General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemediti The RSF also known as Janjaweed was founded by Al Bashir to crush a rebellion in Darfur that began more than 20 years ago It was then transformed into a semiorganised paramilitary force by Al Bashir in 2013 with their leaders being deployed in South Sudan to crush a rebellion In 2019 RSF together with the Sudanese Armed Forces cooperated to oust Al Bashir However efforts to transition to a democratic civilianled government fell through following a coup in October 2021 Speaking to Newsbookcommt Bashir explained that the majority of the Sudanese in Malta are asylum seekers who are seeking for protection “It is now evident why they need protection” Bashir said as she insisted that by offering them some stability the Sudanese in Malta can feel safe and can also help their families back in Sudan “Applications for protection by Sudanese are usually rejected In our community we have a large number of Sudanese whose application has been rejected They are from Darfur and would have moved to Khartoum Now you can see how they are suffering” she said “They should be given some form of protection even temporary protection – it is better than nothing at all” Bashir underlined Describing Sudan as a rich country Bashir reminisced that the people were hopeful after the Al Bashir regime collapsed in 2019 following a 30year dictatorial rule “The hands of Al Bashir are still there” she said and noted that the democratic transition faltered Like diplomats in Khartoum who warned in early 2022 that violence would eventually break out the people of Sudan were expecting something to happen Asked if foreign nations could be involved in what was taking place Bashir said she could not accuse anyone adding that Sudanese suspect the involvement of third parties however it is not yet visible Whilst comparisons are odious the situation in Sudan was compared to the invasion of Ukraine with Bashir describing it “worse” since her conationals were being killed by Sudanese themselves “It is a real disaster Dead bodies on the roads looting and the hospitals are not functioning” she explained Moreover bordering countries are not safe “The countries are not 100 safe and people are waiting for help at the border” she said Bashir also added that there is hardly any media presence in the country documenting what is happening The Sudanese community in Malta is quite sizeable with the members having family back home The clashes brought with them internet outages making it difficult for Sudanese in Malta to reach out to their relatives back home A Sudanese in Malta had five of his family members killed during the clashes The former politician underlined that it was important that the general public in Malta to be aware of what is happening in Sudan “They need to know what is happening in our country and pray for the people in danger” Bashir said and added that Sudan also needed humanitarian assistance “There are organisations that moved in to assist the people in Turkey and Syria now the Sudanese need the same things we would be very grateful if they help out” she said Speaking about her political stint in Sudan Bashir said it was hard to be a woman and a politician representing the opposition party Among the five people elected she was the only woman representing women in the Red Sea state for five years “As a parliament member in an Opposition party you are not protected” Bashir recalled adding that one could easily be jailed because of a differing political opinion However she feels she delivered her message while in office Watch the full interview below

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

A life in art: Adonai Camilleri Cauchi,"April 21, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti One of artist Adonai Camilleri Cauchi’s earliest memories is of making his first ever statue – a small clay statuette – when he was just twoandahalf years old It was at that time that Adonai had discovered that his own father Michael Camilleri Cauchi was a sculptor by profession Excited by the discovery he begged his dad for some clay so that he could emulate him Adonai still remembers his firstever work – a statuette of St George – in perfect detail even if it has since been lost It was obviously a child’s work he makes clear – the head would come off and a cocktail stick served as the saint’s sword – but it set him on the path of a lifelong passion and career “I kept at it my mind was always on this track” he tells Newsbookcommt “Every time you see where mistakes were made and you struggle against yourself so that you do better next time” His family background also served as an inspiration – “art dominated my life” he notes – since Adonai and his father are far from the only members of their family who took up art as a profession His grandfather is the late Gozitan statuemaker Agostino Camilleri popularly known as Wistin talIstatwi and all of Wistin’s four sons including Michael ended up making a career out of art as have a number of their children including Adonai “My work needs a lot of patience and a lot of time and the more professional you set out to be the more time and attention it requires” he observes And a few more arms would not go amiss he quips demand for his work he says gratefully is strong Adonai’s oeuvre includes countless examples of religious art which can be found in Malta as well as overseas and he frequently works in collaboration with his father on statues “Practically every Gozitan locality” exhibits their works during their village feasts and they are far from alone in doing so As one might expect it is not easy for an artist to describe his favourite work and Adonai is no exception though he has a particular fondness for his wooden statues – not least given the physicality involved in making them “You struggle to create them your arms and back go sore when you work in wood – but they are special because of it” One recent work he is particularly pleased with however is his bust of the Blessed Carlo Acutis an Italian youth and amateur computer programmer who had created a website to catalogue miracles around the world before his death from leukaemia at the age of just 15 in 2006 The bust – which incorporates a relic of Acutis – now takes pride of place at the Church of St Mary of Jesus ta’ Ġieżu in Rabat and Adonai is pleased not just with how it came out but with the public’s response “May all those who pray to him – myself included – receive God’s grace” he maintains The sacred aspect of religious artwork does not escape Adonai who speaks fondly during the interview about one of his father’s works – a crucifix at the Nadur parish church “When I look at it I always feel two emotions” Adonai observes “There’s obviously the artistic aspect it is a very good work But because it is so beautiful it also brings you closer to God”

Edward Scicluna insists he played no role in Electrogas selection,"April 20, 2023 5:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Former finance minister Edward Scicluna reiterated that he had nothing to do with the controversial selection of Electrogas for a new gasfired power station at Delimara days after Keith Schembri testified under oath that the current Central Bank of Malta governor necessarily had to be involved in a project of the scale But Scicluna appeared to downplay any suggestions that Schembri lied under oath when he made his statements pointing out that the Finance Ministry had to be involved subsequently when Electrogas was granted a controversial €360 million guarantee for its loans Schembri’s statements to the Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday – which also saw him contradict former deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta stating that he would say “what it suited him to say” – had led the Nationalist Party MPs on the committee to call for the police to investigate The MPs argued that since Schembri had contradicted both Valletta and Schembri’s statements to the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia this meant that either the two men had committed a crime by lying under oath or Schembri himself had done so The police are not pursuing the MPs’ call with any particular urgency it appears with Scicluna confirming that the police had not yet contacted him The minister sought to argue that there was no inherent contradiction between his claims and Schembri’s own even as he washed his hands off the selection process that ultimately favoured the Electrogas consortium Scicluna said that as others had he had been given a presentation on a switch to gas before the election and that as a cabinet minister he had backed the project to switch to gaspowered electricity generation But he emphasised that Enemalta was one of various public entities whose public procurement processes took place independently of the Finance Ministry the selection process Scicluna argued was thus entirely the responsibility of the energy minister at the time Konrad Mizzi “The expression of interest the evaluations the due diligence process were all the energy ministry’s responsibility” he said Scicluna also sought to downplay the description of a “kitchen cabinet” within Joseph Muscat’s government that he had made in his testimony to the inquiry which he formed no part of Back then his assertion appeared to serve as a way for Scicluna to distance himself from the most controversial parts of Muscat’s legacy But the Central Bank governor now said that the term was a “neutral” one which described a state of affairs that was normal to most governments each head of government he said had an inner circle of advisors to help guide their decisionmaking
Palazzina Vincenti gets Grade 2 protection,"April 20, 2023 4:56 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Plans to demolish Palazzina Vincenti and replace it with a highrise hotel can no longer go through after the Planning Authority has declared the austere modernist house along the St Julians promenade to be a Grade 2 scheduled building The PA is also scheduling as Grade 2 properties the facades of the two adjacent houses abutting Palazzina Vincenti on both sites scheduling their interior as a Grade 3 structure Palazzina Vincenti dates back to the postwar period and was designed and built by the architect Gustavo Romeo Vincenti to serve as his own personal residence Vincenti lived at the house until his death in 1974 The distinctive house showcases Vincenti’s talent for utilising circular and square geometric shapes in his designs and is a pioneering example of modernist architecture making use of reinforced concrete in a domestic setting in Malta But hotelier Carlo Stivala had planned to flatten the structure to make way for a 14storey hotel – with three additional underground levels – on the plans of architect Robert Musumeci These plans led the Planning Authority to issue an emergency conservation order for a property considered to be heritage at risk effectively granting the property Grade 1 protection until a full assessment determined the level of protection it truly merited Grade 1 protection prohibits interventions “which impair the setting or change the external or internal appearance including anything contained within the curtilage of the building” In the end however the process concluded that Palazzina Vincenti merited the lesser Grade 2 protection which specifies that permission to demolish “will not normally be given” and which allows alterations to the interior “if proposed to be carried out sensitively and causing the least detriment to the character and architectural homogeneity of the building” In any case PA emphasised that the development application “will need to be radically modified to ensure that the palazzina is restored back to its original glory which it so well deserves”

Appeals court convicts men who illegally detained journalists at Castille in 2019,"May 16, 2023 10:09 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected After that press conference at around 3am on 29 November three men who refused to identify themselves but who appeared to act as plainclothes security guards kept the journalists from leaving the building The trio were subsequently identified as Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay and charged with illegally detaining four journalists – Agius Xuereb Paul Caruana Galizia and Julian Bonnici While more journalists were present – as footage of the incident showed – their version of events was never sought The case did not appear to have been treated with any urgency by the police a police report was filed on 2 December 2019 by Agius and Xuereb with the former presenting footage she filmed on her phone as evidence and charges were issued on 14 July Despite this delay Magistrate Joe Mifsud had found the police investigation to be lacking and in his acquittal of the three men he argued that his hands were tied by the charge – and evidence – presented by the prosecution In his view the evidence was not sufficient to prove the charge to the level required by the court But the Office of the Attorney General ended up filing an appeal in which it insisted that Magistrate Mifsud drew his conclusion on the basis of an erroneous application of the law Lawyer Etienne Savona had highlighted that the defendants were clearly impeding access to the door journalists had used to enter Castille and that such behaviour gave the journalists the impression that a physical confrontation would emerge if they persisted in their attempts to leave the building Ultimately Judge Aaron Bugeja upheld the AG’s appeal overturning the acquittal and finding the three men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest The judge opted to conditionally discharge the trio for 6 months giving them the standard warning that committing another offence in this period would also see them punished for the illegal arrest they carried out at the Office of the Prime Minister
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
CJEU rules that beach concessions should not be automatically renewed,"April 20, 2023 12:48 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that beach concessions should not be renewed automatically but must be subject to an impartial and transparent selection procedure In the case C34822 concerning a beach in the municipality of Ginosa in the Italian province of Taranto Apulia the CJEU ruled that in order to grant concessions for the occupation of Stateowned maritime property EU Member States must apply a selection procedure for potential candidates when the number of spaces available for a particular activity is limited because of the scarcity of natural resources It also held that the authorisation must be granted for an appropriate limited duration and cannot be open to automatic renewal In this particular case the Municipality of Ginosa extended in its territory concessions for the occupation of Stateowned maritime property The decision failed to comply with the principles of competition and freedom of establishment and thus the Italian Competition and Markets Authority AGCM issued a reasoned opinion to the Municipality of Ginosa reminding it of the requirement for a prior public procurement procedure After the Municipality of Ginosa refused to comply with this opinion the AGCM brought an action before the Regional Administrative Court of Puglia for the annulment of the municipality’s decision The Regional Administrative Court found the national provisions to be incompatible with Directive 2006123 on services in the internal market and decided that the EU directive should have been adopted unanimously rather than by a majority of the votes of the Council Thus the Regional Administrative Court referred several questions to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling to ascertain how the directive ought to be applied In turn the CJEU ruled that the obligation for Member States to apply an impartial and transparent selection procedure to potential candidates and the prohibition on automatic renewal of an authorisation granted for a given activity are laid down unconditionally and sufficiently precisely by the directive Since these rules have direct effect the national courts and the administrative authorities including municipal authorities are under an obligation to apply them and also to disapply national rules which conflict with them This puts into question the recent extension of the concessions authorising operators to place deckchairs at Comino’s Blue Lagoon which are being renewed without a tender this year Despite previous assertions that a call for tenders would be issued Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo has confirmed that they will be renewed without a tender

Man responsible for death of motorcyclist Marie Claire Lombardi released on bail,"April 20, 2023 9:22 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The man who left slippery material on the road that led to the death of motorcyclist Marie Claire Lombardi has been released on bail after he appeared in Court on Thursday morning The man a 79yearold resident of Dingli is being charged with the involuntary homicide of Lombardi after he allegedly left slippery material on the road which caused Lombardi to skid and lose control of her motorcycle On Thursday the man who is being charged before Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo pleaded not guilty to the accusations He was granted bail on a personal guarantee of €50000 and on the condition that he signs a bail book three times a week and does not approach any witnesses Lombardi a 45yearold woman from Mġarr tragically lost her life in a traffic accident on 22 October 2022 after losing control of her motorcycle and falling off of it The incident was reported at 530pm on Triq lImdina in Rabat A medical team was called on site and the woman was taken to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment however she was certified dead shortly afterwards The Police had determined that the woman probably lost control of her motorcycle due to slippery material that was left on the road and had appealed for information on who might have left the material on the road
Government gives no figures on response to courts finding laws unconstitutional,"April 20, 2023 7:00 AM",The government does not appear to keep proper records of court sentences which find any legal instrument to be unconstitutional or in breach of human rights – and of how often this is addressed – if a parliamentary question answered by justice minister Jonathan Attard is any indication Nationalist Party MP Albert Buttigieg had sought to find out how many court sentences declared that a legal instrument in force in Malta – or any provisions thereof – to be in breach of the Constitution or  any other human rights Article 242 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedures COCP highlights that whenever such a judgment which has become res judicata – and is thus considered definitively settled by the courts – declares that a legal provision runs counter to the Constitution or to any human right or fundamental freedom established in the European Convention on Human Rights a copy is sent to Parliament It also states that within a period of six months of the judgment the prime minister may make regulations deleting the instrument or provision declared to run counter to the Constitution or the Convention Accordingly Buttigieg had initially asked prime minister Robert Abela how many such sentences had been issued and how often has he intervened in accordance with the provisions of COCP The MP was however advised to direct his questions to the ministry concerned leading him to make the same question to Attard This time round however he was told that the question could not be answered because doing so “would exceed the advisory cost limit” Ministers are empowered to refuse answering a parliamentary question if compiling the information required would exceed this cost limit No such cost limit is actually specified in Maltese parliamentary procedures but Speaker Anġlu Farrugia and a number of predecessors have justified such refusal on the basis of such procedures being adopted in other Parliaments using the Westminster system not least the UK Parliament But in any case Attard’s citing of the advisory cost limit confirms that the government holds no easilyaccessible records on the court judgments which find Maltese laws to be in breach of the Constitution or the European Convention a reasonable cost limit would presumably not have been exceeded had there been one And in the meantime the public is left with no indication of how efficient the government is in responding to situations where Maltese laws breach their rights

Air Malta’s retirement and redundancy schemes cost €60.8m last year,"April 19, 2023 7:27 PM",Over €608 million in public funds were spent last year on the early retirement scheme and the voluntary retirement scheme offered to Air Malta’s staff as the national airline sought to downsize in a bid to survive a futile bid if statements by its executive chairperson made this week are any indication In reply to a parliamentary question by Nationalist Party MP Ivan Castillo finance minister Clyde Caruana said that 351 workers received a payout under both schemes and received €6083633244 – an average of over €173000 apiece – as a result Payouts under both schemes were capped at €300000 with the actual payout depending on their takehome pay and their years of service Despite Curmi’s declaration that a new state airline would be replacing Air Malta by the end of the year – as had happened in neighbouring Italy when Alitalia made way for ITA in 2021 – the government has not officially confirmed this maintaining that discussions on the matter are still pending at the European Commission However the Commission is reported to have informally shot down Malta’s request for state aid to Air Malta as unworkable The trade unions representing Air Malta’s employees also appear to have been kept in the dark about its future the General Workers Union has since asked for an urgent meeting with Caruana
"PN MPs head to police after Schembri claims Scicluna, Valletta lied under oath","April 19, 2023 6:54 PM",The Nationalist Party’s members on the Public Accounts Committee have asked police commissioner Angelo Gafà to pursue criminal proceedings after former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri indicated that former minister Edward Scicluna and former deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta had lied under oath PAC chair Darren Carabott David Agius and Graham Bencini highlighted that since Schembri was himself under oath when he made his claims when questioned by the committee on Wednesday at least one crime had been committed – either the perjury Schembri alleged or his own Schembri’s claims concerned the statements Scicluna – now governor of the Central Bank of Malta – and Valletta had made to the public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia which found the state had to shoulder responsibility for her death On Tuesday Schembri insisted that “lots of lies” had been said during the public inquiry as he specifically singled out the two men Valletta had told the inquiry that Schembri had called him to persuade him to call off the questioning of Yorgen Fenech who was subsequently charged and indicted over his alleged role in the murder But Schembri insisted that Valletta said “what it paid him to say” In a similar vein Schembri rubbished Scicluna’s claims of a “kitchen cabinet” an inner circle that was responsible for big decisions while the actual cabinet – which he formed part of – was frozen out Schembri dismissed these claims and insisted that Scicluna would have been involved in the major decisions he sought to wash his hands off In their letter to Gafà delivered to the police HQ in Floriana the three MPs made references to the statements of all three men and emphasised the disagreements “The versions of events offered by the three people in question under oath to the PAC and to the board of inquiry makes clear that someone has lied under oath” they said “Consequently the police commissioner has been asked to take all the measures necessary”
Parliament bickers as it approves domestic violence bill,"April 19, 2023 6:12 PM",The tense atmosphere that has characterised Parliament on its return from Easter recess this week did not fail to make an appearance on Wednesday even though MPs were closing debate on an uncontroversial bill that they all agree upon a Domestic Violence Prevention Act The bill aims to empower people to inquire whether their romantic partners have a history of domestic violence effectively serving as a Maltese version of the UK’s Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme popularly known as “Clare’s Law” after a woman who was murdered by an ex with an extensive criminal background The UK law was explicitly mentioned as an inspiration but the Maltese bill as it stands is considerably less powerful than the British legislation which provides for both the “right to ask” and the “right to know” the latter involves empowering police to disclose information to the public on their own initiative The proposed law only provides for the former requiring people who fear that they are at risk of domestic violence to make an application with the police The scene for Wednesday’s bickering had actually been set on Tuesday when opposition MPs walked out of Parliament after speaker Anġlu Farrugia denied opposition leader Bernard Grech’s request for an urgent debate on Air Malta after its executive chairperson David Curmi confirmed that it will be wound down by the end of the year The bill was next on the agenda leading government MPs – not least parliamentary secretary Rebecca Buttigieg and minister Byron Camilleri – to accuse PN MPs of failing to give domestic violence the importance due Buttigieg said that she “never doubted” that Grech was insincere whenever he spoke on domestic violence Later that evening Buttigieg’s social media declaration saw her roundly condemned by Nationalist Party MP Eve Borg Bonello who said that it was the parliamentary secretary who lacked any credibility on domestic violence given Labour’s failure to act against Żejtun local councillor Gesmond Baldacchino who was convicted of punching his sisterinlaw She also highlighted MEP Cyrus Engerer’s past conviction for revenge porn In spite of all this the discussion on Wednesday initially proceeded without incident before opposition whip Robert Cutajar made a lastminute intervention to condemn the government’s assertions Cutajar insisted that it was unacceptable for government MPs to “seek to score points on such a sensitive issue” He highlighted that for all these remarks government MPs had been largely absent from Parliament’s chamber during the debate with just three present at one point Had he used the government’s yardstick he argued he could have called for a quorum and disrupted procedures to be able to claim that Labour was indifferent to domestic violence But as Camilleri wound up debate he insisted that Cutajar’s remarks forced him to do something he was not planning to refer yet again to the incidents that took place on Tuesday “When we were discussing such an important subject the opposition chose to abandon Parliament” he insisted leading Cutajar to invoke a point of order to respond – incorrectly according to the speaker Camilleri soon invoked a point of order after Cutajar reportedly described Buttigieg as someone “still at the beginning of life” describing this remark as “an act of moral violence” Further shouting ensued with Farrugia at one point kicking out PN MP Darren Carabott – though this order was not apparently followed through It was then Grech’s turn to invoke a point of order stating that Camilleri was accusing the opposition of ridiculing the discussion “when he has spent 7 minutes without saying anything substantial” Farrugia insisted that this was no point of order before Camilleri retorted that the most substantial achievement Grech had achieved was “a record electoral defeat” But it was soon the minister’s turn to be disciplined by Farrugia over his repeated descriptions of Grech as a “cheap politician” this was unparliamentary language Farrugia insisted and Camilleri soon withdrew his words with some reluctance Within a minute however it was government whip Andy Ellul’s turn to invoke a point of order with Ellul accusing Grech of addressing insults to government MP that he did not wish to repeat publicly “I am not saying them publicly but we all heard them” Ellul insisted Farrugia however insisted that he had not heard anything prompting Ellul to challenge Grech “Repeat what you just said if you’re a real man” he exclaimed In response Grech said that he had no doubts he was a man but insisted that he had not said what was apparently being attributed to him Farrugia once more emphasised that he had not heard anything and shut down discussion on the matter Camilleri then recalled the less than complementary words Grech had said on Andrea Prudente during debate on the bill amending abortion legislation but the bickering then died down and by the end the minister made an apparent attempt at magnanimity “I hope we don’t descend to these levels the next time we are involved in a similar debate” the minister said “And I am even putting myself in this even if I may have a different opinion on what happened”
Steward warns hospitals transition risks impacting on ‘quality of care’,"April 19, 2023 3:36 PM",Steward Health Care Malta has accused the government of continuing what it described as a “deliberate and calculated manipulation of the narrative” concerning the hospitals concession struck down by a court sentence in response to the announcement that the government had defeated an International Chamber of Commerce emergency arbitration proceeding Last Friday the government had made a brief announcement in which it said that it “cannot comment further on pending legal proceedings” limiting itself to stating that the case was related to the termination of the concession and that it won the emergency arbitration with Steward ordered to bear costs In a statement issued on Wednesday Steward elaborated that the decision to file for emergency arbitration was a result of “serious concerns surrounding the escalation of the termination dispute and its impact on the necessary handover process” It emphasised that the transition “is a complex process involving legacy contracts IT infrastructure and HR transfers among many other matters” and that “should an orderly transition not be conducted the quality of care could be impacted” The company insisted that it always acted in the interest of patients and the community but said that the government’s lack of experience in the transfer process and its “hesitancy” to engage with it “is concerning and led to an unnecessary delay of the transition” It said that economics were not a topic of discussion in this particular dispute Steward also stressed that the decision of the ICC “in no way prejudices the merits of the claim” and observed that as the transition process moved forward the government would “bear the medical legal responsibility in any decisions made unilaterally”
Mandatory union membership is anti-democratic – Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara,"May 15, 2023 8:53 PM",Mandatory trade union membership is a violation of human dignity and democracy Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara Young Christian Workers’ Movement said on Monday In a statement ŻĦN said that while “unionisation is an empowering and liberating act affirming the dignity of all work and workers” it opposed mandatory membership “First of all ŻĦN regards this as an infringement of the basic democratic right of freedom of association concurring with the Maltese Constitutional Court and European Court of Human Rights” Secondly ŻĦN said it is suspicious of the effectiveness of the proposal which was included in the Labour party’s electoral programme ahead of last year’s victory at the polls “It has been claimed that this “would boost the fight against precarious employment and exploitation” How would obligatory membership in unions that have not uttered but a whisper on the death of Jean Paul Sofia or hundreds of other workers who have lost life or limb on construction sites protect workers from precarity” ŻĦN said ŻĦN also took aim at the leaders of Malta’s biggest unions – the General Workers Union GWU and UĦM – with the movement saying that “we have a situation where the leaders of the two main unions are on the government payroll eroding the faith of honest workers in the impartiality of union structures To propose mandatory membership as a remedy is autocratic and absurd” “It is a mature evaluation of the structure and operation of unions in Malta that is required as well as a hardnosed analysis of the slow erosion of workers’ rights and conditions that is creeping in” ŻĦN added The proposal has also been heavily criticised by business lobbies with the Malta Employers’ Association MEA the Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry and the Malta Chamber of SMEs have urging the Labour administration to withdraw its proposal Last year the business lobbies said that the measure as proposed is “regressive and undemocratic” and will not in any way strengthen the state of industrial relations and social dialogue in Malta Before the March 2022 election prime minister Robert Abela said that although he believed vulnerable workers should be protected he was open to discuss mandatory union membership with business leaders However both main unions support the proposal with GWU general secretary Josef Bugeja urging Abela to introduce mandatory membership in the run up to this year’s May Day Bugeja said this could help fight precarious employment Likewise UĦM boss Josef Vella said that the union has long called for mandatory union membership for low income workers who are often exploited by employers

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Mandatory union membership is anti-democratic – Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara,"May 15, 2023 8:53 PM",Mandatory trade union membership is a violation of human dignity and democracy Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara Young Christian Workers’ Movement said on Monday In a statement ŻĦN said that while “unionisation is an empowering and liberating act affirming the dignity of all work and workers” it opposed mandatory membership “First of all ŻĦN regards this as an infringement of the basic democratic right of freedom of association concurring with the Maltese Constitutional Court and European Court of Human Rights” Secondly ŻĦN said it is suspicious of the effectiveness of the proposal which was included in the Labour party’s electoral programme ahead of last year’s victory at the polls “It has been claimed that this “would boost the fight against precarious employment and exploitation” How would obligatory membership in unions that have not uttered but a whisper on the death of Jean Paul Sofia or hundreds of other workers who have lost life or limb on construction sites protect workers from precarity” ŻĦN said ŻĦN also took aim at the leaders of Malta’s biggest unions – the General Workers Union GWU and UĦM – with the movement saying that “we have a situation where the leaders of the two main unions are on the government payroll eroding the faith of honest workers in the impartiality of union structures To propose mandatory membership as a remedy is autocratic and absurd” “It is a mature evaluation of the structure and operation of unions in Malta that is required as well as a hardnosed analysis of the slow erosion of workers’ rights and conditions that is creeping in” ŻĦN added The proposal has also been heavily criticised by business lobbies with the Malta Employers’ Association MEA the Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry and the Malta Chamber of SMEs have urging the Labour administration to withdraw its proposal Last year the business lobbies said that the measure as proposed is “regressive and undemocratic” and will not in any way strengthen the state of industrial relations and social dialogue in Malta Before the March 2022 election prime minister Robert Abela said that although he believed vulnerable workers should be protected he was open to discuss mandatory union membership with business leaders However both main unions support the proposal with GWU general secretary Josef Bugeja urging Abela to introduce mandatory membership in the run up to this year’s May Day Bugeja said this could help fight precarious employment Likewise UĦM boss Josef Vella said that the union has long called for mandatory union membership for low income workers who are often exploited by employers

required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Opposition walks out of Parliament after Speaker denies urgent Air Malta debate request,"April 18, 2023 7:45 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The finance minister has objected to a request to hold an urgent parliamentary debate on Air Malta saying that meetings with the European Commission are still in progress During Tuesday’s session Opposition leader Bernard Grech asked for an immediate debate on the ailing national airline saying that this was a matter of definite national importance and public interest as laid down in the standing orders Quoting Air Malta’s chiarman Times of Malta reported that the airline would close down by the end of the year and would be seamlessly replaced by another one earlier during the day Meanwhile The Shift News had already reported that Air Malta would be closed down after summer In parliament finance minister Clyde Caruana said he would have no problem discussing Air Malta once the talks on state aid with the European Commission are concluded He added that another meeting is due in a fortnight According to the finance minister there were five points of disagreement between Brussels and Malta and that the talks are taking long because the matter is complex He insisted that the government is doing its best to safeguard the national interest the interest of the airline and that of its employees Caruana added that the Commission was still evaluating the proposals based on the data provided by Malta Opposition leader Bernard Grech accused the government of not being transparent and insisted that Air Malta employees deserved to be told what is being planned behind their backs Grech said it was “shameful” that parliament would not discuss important matters after Speaker of the House Anġlu Farrugia turned down an Opposition motion to hold a parliamentary discussion on requests by Jean Paul Sofia’s mother for a public inquiry into her son’s death After Tuesday’s sitting was suspended for an hour the Speaker ruled that while the subject was important talks were still ongoing Farrugia recommended talks between the government and the Opposition for a debate at a future date
AG ducks questions about decision not to prosecute Pilatus Bank officials,"April 18, 2023 5:33 PM",Videos Miguela Xuereb Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg refused to answer any questions about newly published correspondence which shows that the authorities first decided not to prosecute two Pilatus bank officials and then worked backwards to justify the decision despite recommendations by the inquiring magistrate to the contrary Buttigieg was among the attendees at a press conference held by justice minister Jonathan Attard during which the government unveiled its proposed reform for criminal proceedings Government officials sought to stop journalists from approaching Buttigieg once the press conference was over with the justice ministry spokesperson insisting that questions were only for the minister However journalists insisted and got through to Buttigieg who was quickly shielded by individuals present and accompanied out of the venue Buttigieg together with the police decided not to prosecute Pilatus bank risk manager Antoniella Gauci and operations supervisor Mehmet Tasli and later sought to justify a decision which had already been taken This emerged in a new 700page book authored by anticorruption activist and Repubblika president Robert Aquilina In Pilatus A laundromat bank in Europe Aquilina published a series of emails which show how three police inspectors discussed how they needed “points” to justify the decision by the Attorney General not to prosecute Gauci and Tasli despite the magisterial inquiry recommending that they are prosecuted in connection to financial crime Journalists sought to ask Buttigieg why a decision not to prosecute – a nolle prosequi – was first issued and then reasons were sought to justify the decision However Buttigieg walked out straight of the building During the press conference a Times of Malta journalist asked minister Jonathan Attard whether the published emails were a matter of concern The minister instead diverted the attention onto Aquilina and said “The information… Do you know what worries me That you have a person who instituted proceedings which are still ongoing and from what I gathered from the media reports this information is not new because it was used in the same proceedings and on the other hand despite instituting these proceedings he published this book” Attard was referring to the judicial review action instituted by Aquilina seeking to challenge the AG’s decision not to prosecute Gauci and Tasli A judicial review action is a type of proceeding in which a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision or action made by a public body “I leave judicial proceedings in courts Such proceedings should not take place in press conferences blogs or books” Pressed if the information worried him Attard said “Why should it worry me Should it worry me because a book has been published while proceedings are ongoing Let’s allow the courts to their work Once he trusted the institutions enough to institute proceedings in court and seek remedy sic from the court then let the institutions work” A judicial review action is not a remedy through such an action the court can only annul a decision but it cannot substitute its discretion for that of the AG’s by ordering it to prosecute or otherwise
"Keith Schembri claims that Edward Scicluna, Silvio Valletta, lied when testifying under oath","April 18, 2023 3:00 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Former OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri has claimed that former finance minister turned Central Bank governor Edward Scicluna and former deputy commissioner Silvio Valletta lied under oath The righthand man to disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday afternoon where the Auditor General’s damning report into contracts awarded to Electrogas to run a power station is being examined Before he entered into the House of Representatives Schembri waved and shook his hand with Konrad Mizzi’s father Testifying before MPs Schembri said that “lots of lies” had been said during the public inquiry Valletta had told the public inquiry into journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination that Schembri had rung him up to call off the questioning of murder suspect Yorgen Fenech “Are you going to question someone on the basis of an article in The Times” Valletta said Schembri told him The former chief of staff insisted that Valletta said “what it paid him to say” With regards to the kitchen cabinet claim by former finance minister Edward Scicluna Schembri similarly rubbished the claim Scicluna had told the panel of judges that big government decisions were taken by an inner circle that operated outside the confines of cabinet Schembri insisted that there was no kitchen cabinet and stressed that Scicluna would have been involved in major decisions In December Scicluna had appeared before the PAC and said that he was directly involved in the Electrogas project only once when the government had decided in favour of the €360 state guarantee for Electrogas Asked why he did not file any libel proceedings since according to him they had lied about him Schembri said “god forbid I had to point out each and every lie said during the public inquiry” However he stopped short of highlighting other instances where “lies” had been said in open court under oath During Tuesday’s sessions there were many instances during which Schembri claimed that he could remember certain details Schembri also insisted that everything he has ever done he had kept Muscat abreast of the details and underlined that he never did anything behind Muscat’s back Muscat was driven out of office through national protests that ensued after the arrest of thenTumas Group CEO Yorgen Fenech in relation to the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia Asked about the change to a gasfired power station Schembri said the direction had been given by Muscat adding that the Labour Party’s decision making structure is pyramidlike The costings of the project had been carried out by disgraced energy minister Konrad Mizzi and David Galea – a childhood friend of the former Louis Grech had then analysed the numbers Schembri explained Schembri was also asked about his “golden touch” During the last sitting the former chief of staff told the committee that Mizzi wanted to replicate his golden touch Questioned further about his Midas touch Schembri said he could not recalled where the conversation with had taken place He added that it happened about ten times He added he saw nothing wrong with the statement because many would pose similar questions and he was sure that Mizzi was referring to the businessman’s life after politics Asked about his secret offshore company Tillgate Inc Schembri claimed he could not remember authorising Nexia BT to open the company for him In his testimony Schembri first claimed that he never authorised the auditing firm to open the offshore company for him saying he had authorised them to open a trust in New Zealand The reply was met with incredulity by the Opposition MPs sitting on the committee Opposition MP Graham Bencini asked how did he authorise them to open a bank account for the company since leaked documents from the Panama Papers show that Schembri had indeed authorised Nexia BT to open up a bank account in the Bahamas for the company He quickly changed his version claiming that he could not remember giving his consent to Nexia BT to open the company According to Schembri Nexia BT only informed him that a Panama company was needed after the New Zealand trust had been opened “I did not know Panama was a tax haven I didn’t ask any questions” he claimed and added that the money was going to go to New Zealand not Panama Faced with another leaked email which detailed how both he and Mizzi were to have millions paid into their offshore structures by 17 Black owned by Fenech Schembri insisted that the Panama company was set up for his future business plans once he left politics The email described 17 Black as a “target client” of Schembri and Mizzi’s Panama companies The former chief of staff said “when born a businessman you will always think like a businessman” He did not recall whether it was he or Fenech who initiated the conversation about going into business together Schembri also claimed that it was a “coincidence” that the Panama company was opened at the same time Mizzi set up his “So you are telling me Konrad Mizzi had the same target companies as you” PAC chairman Darren Carabott remarked to which Schembri replied “ask him” On Egrant Schembri insisted that at that stage the company had not been used and therefore would have been owned by Nexia BT The former chief of staff said that throughout his years in government he wanted to resign multiple times but Muscat had never accepted his resignation He also could not recall whether he spoke to Muscat or Mizzi after Times of Malta revealed that 17 Black was owned by Fenech

Malta’s solar panels generated 284.6 GWh of electricity last year,"April 18, 2023 12:19 PM",Malta’s photovoltaic panels generated a total of 2846 gigawatt hours GWh of energy last year some 70 GWh shy of their nominal potential The figures were provided by energy minister Miriam Dalli in reply to a parliamentary question by the Nationalist Party MP Stanley Zammit The nominal capacity of the photovoltaic panels that were installed in Malta last year was 3552 GWh Dalli explained She said that the shortfall between this capacity and the actual generation of electricity was likely attributable to various factors including a degradation in the capacity of the PV panels over the years a lack of maintenance or cleaning as well as natural variations in the sunshine they were exposed to Dalli also confirmed that the figures did not take into account other potential losses including distribution losses However she emphasised that distribution losses were likely low since many PV panels would be installed on the roofs of houses and other buildings As a result the distance between the PV panels and the power outlets through which the energy generated was consumed tends to be small keeping distribution losses to a minimum

Air Malta boss confirms airline to be wound down this year,"April 18, 2023 10:27 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The death of Air Malta on the year in which it marks its 50th anniversary has now been confirmed by its executive chairperson David Curmi In an interview with The Times however Curmi insisted that the transition into a new airline would be “largely seamless for passengers” He also insisted that the airline’s workers – which will inevitably face layoffs – can apply to join its replacement although the interview did not elaborate on any changes in working conditions this would lead to Last Saturday The Shift had reported that the airline would close after summer after the European Commission informed the government that there was no chance that a proposed €290 million aid package would be approved under the EU’s state aid rules This left the government with no option but to dissolve the airline and create a new flag carrier as Italy had done when Alitalia made way for ITA in 2021 Curmi said that the Commission recommended that Malta follow Italy’s approach and promised that Malta would continue to have a national airline – one which he insisted would never become a lowcost carrier He insisted that despite the failure to secure the state aid package Air Malta had nevertheless succeeded in showing Brussels that the airline – long seen as a manner for politicians to provide lucrative jobs and favours – was no longer serving as an extension of the government Air Malta had been registered as a limited liability company on 30 March 1973 days after a resolution to this effect was approved by Parliament Given the circumstances perhaps unsurprisingly this milestone anniversary came and went with little fanfare with the airline making no announcement marking the occasion
New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”

IĠM calls on Abela to denounce illegal detention of journalists,"May 17, 2023 3:40 PM",The Institute of Maltese Journalists IĠM called on prime minister Robert Abela to denounce the illegal detention of journalists at Castille in 2019 This week a Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected In a statement on Wednesday IĠM stressed that such ugly scenes should not be repeated and said it expects the government to “disassociate itself from these three bullies – Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay – who were found guilty of illegally detaining journalists following a press conference by the Prime Minister” Although court found the men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest no action has been taken against officials at the Prime Minister’s Office then occupied by Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat On the day the three men who refused to identify themselves appeared to act as plainclothes security guards to keep the journalists from leaving the building “Not only were the journalists illegally detained but effectively silenced” IĠM said It added that it now expects the government to act to ensure that these men are not reengaged for government events “The authorities must ensure that similar incidents are not repeated and that journalists are allowed to go about doing their job with utmost freedom and respect and in an environment befitting the fourth estate of democracy”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he

PM ‘eroding trust in state’s ability to deliver justice’ – Repubblika,"April 18, 2023 10:01 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Civil society organisation Repubblika took aim at prime minister Robert Abela’s failure to make any public reaction to the evidence published on its president Robert Aquilina’s book “Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe” arguing that this continued to erode trust in the state’s ability – or will – to deliver justice “Instead of saying what he can do now that he cannot hide the evidence any longer Robert Abela insults Robert Aquilina and whoever insists for justice claiming they are wasting their time” the NGO said In his speech at the closing of the Labour Party’s general conference Abela appeared to make only a passing contemptuous reference to the publication suggesting that others should “stick to books and blogs whilst we continue to lead” as highlighted by Newsbookcommt Repubblika insisted that a weightier response was necessary given that the published evidence “shows that the owner and top officials of Pilatus Bank carried out serious crimes that incur long prison terms Yet the police and the attorney general did their utmost to ensure that these criminals can evade justice” It highlighted that the authorities actions appear to have been motivated by a desire to protect Keith Schembri – who was known to hold an account in Pilatus Bank – and former PM Joseph Muscat and to protect one of the officials – Antoniella Gauci – whose family enjoys close ties to Abela “Between them Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela have spent 9 years protecting Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad and his accomplices and they can only do so with the active assistance of police commissioner Angelo Gafà attorney general Victoria Buttigieg and the official leading the FIAU Alfred Zammit” the NGO said This assistance Repubblika argued rendered the officials’ position untenable – even more so after the publication of Aquilina’s book “We can only regain faith in the institutions when we see them respond to the facts and to the truth and not just to the need that Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela continue to enjoy impunity” it concluded
Comino beach concessions extended without tender yet again,"April 18, 2023 9:36 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Despite previous assertions that a call for tenders would be issued the concessions authorising operators to place deckchairs at Comino’s Blue Lagoon are being renewed without a tender this year tourism minister Clayton Bartolo has confirmed But following a year in which the operators’ abusive encroachment on the popular swimming spot garnered controversy the minister is pledging that this time round they will only place deckchairs on a third of the area Speaking to journalists the minister justified the decision to renew the concessions without a tender since the government was yet to finalise a longterm plan for the site Past indications suggest that longterm plans for Comino have not exactly been a priority for the authorities a carrying capacity exercise for the chronicallyovercrowded swimming spot is now 7 years overdue it should have been carried out by 2016 according to the management plan for the Natura 2000 site comprising the entirety of Comino and its islets The Shift had reported that two individuals own the “deckchair racket” at Blue Lagoon One is Mark Cutajar the brother of Labour MEP Josianne Cutajar while the other is Daniel Refalo an associate of the notorious construction tycoon Joseph Portelli They have already benefited from renewals without a call for tenders justified on the grounds of uncertainties created by the pandemic It remains to be seen whether this summer will also see a renewal of the abusive behaviour of past years behaviour which was met with scant enforcement at best – or whether the operators will truly stick to the reduced area they are meant to keep to Bartolo pledged that the beach and the quay would be returned to the public and kept free of deckchairs this time round
Valletta residents threatened over loud music complaints,"April 18, 2023 8:32 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Two owners of Valletta establishment are set to face court proceedings over threats they made to residents who complained about the volume of music they played well into the night as the disruption to Valletta residents’ lives caused by such establishments continues unabated Newsbookcommt spoke to an administrator of the Facebook page Residenti Beltin which has served as a focal point for Valletta residents airing their grievances not least after the Our Lady of Sorrows and Good Friday processions were marred by the presence of catering establishments that placed tables and chairs along the route and who played loud music in flagrant breach of the law The breaches on the occasion of Our Lady of Sorrows failed to bring about any action despite the police being alerted to the case leading to the same situation repeating itself on Good Friday a week later Valletta residents are also still reeling from the fallout ensuing from a controversial notice which allows music to be played until 1am in certain parts of Valletta The page administrator highlighted that the issue is made much worse given a lack of enforcement that gives the locality’s commercial establishments carte blanche to do as they please “The Beltin had already lost their afternoon rest” he said “And now through the legal notice we have also lost peace of mind during the night” The residents’ complaints and calls to the police over excessively loud volumes have fallen on deaf ears – and led to the threats which are set to be followed up in court In their discussions with the police in a bid to see what can be done Valletta residents also offered to pay for a decibel meter that could measure volume levels and help ensure these are within limits But their proposal was shot down by the police who noted that there was no law regulating volume levels rendering the decibel meter pointless Residenti Beltin is thus petitioning Parliament for such a law to be introduced appealing to residents of other localities struggling with loud noises to back its claims The apparent prioritisation of commercial establishments over residents also appears to have spilled over to other issues including parking While Valletta residents accepted the loss of parking spaces to increase open areas in their locality the gain in public spaces has only really served to give commercial establishments more space to encroach upon with their tables and chairs And in the midst of all this the city’s local council is being urged to be more proactive – as it once was – with the page administrator arguing that had the council been more responsible what happened at Holy Week may have been mitigated There had already been incidents at Maundy Thursday it was pointed out – had a proper response been made then perhaps the incidents of Good Friday could have been prevented “But things were left as they were with no interest shown in these religious events that are important to the identity of Valletta and that of the country” he said
"‘My son would still be alive’ had the authorities acted, Isabelle Bonnici tells PM","April 17, 2023 7:40 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Had it not been for the authorities’ failure to act decisively in the wake of the death of Miriam Pace then Jean Paul Sofia could still have been alive his mother said in an exchange with prime minister Robert Abela outside of Parliament on Monday afternoon Isabelle Bonnici personally delivered a letter to MPs as they entered Parliament House on Monday afternoon along with a memorial card commemorating her only son who was killed in a construction site collapse last December Her gesture led opposition leader Bernard Grech to request an urgent debate but this request was opposed by the government and ultimately turned down by speaker Anġlu Farrugia Abela was a late arrival on Monday but Bonnici was still waiting and an exchange of words ensued in which Abela stuck to his opposition to holding a public inquiry into Sofia’s death Instead he argued that Bonnici should back his public appeal to the chief justice to pressure the inquiring magistrate to bring her inquiry into the case to a swift conclusion an appeal which drew criticism among others from the law students’ association Għaqda Studenti talLiġi which accused Abela of scapegoating the magistrate No similar appeal has been made to the police commissioner even though the police have failed to prosecute anyone despite being free to carry out their own investigations independent of the inquiring magistrate Abela argued that a public inquiry was unnecessary since the inquiring magistrate enjoyed full independence and extensive powers but Bonnici stood her ground And his claim that the magisterial inquiry following the death of Miriam Pace in 2020 brought results was perhaps unwise “What actually happened Had anything happened then my son would still be alive” Bonnici replied forcefully “That is why I am calling for a public inquiry” Abela highlighted that the inquiry led to the creation of the Building and Construction Authority – whose chair Maria Schembri Grima had to resign in disgrace last February over a dangerous demolition in a project she was leading as an architect – but this predictably failed to impress Bonnici Bonnici recalled among other things a national registry of contractors that was promised after Pace’s death in her own home as a result of demolition works that triggered a collapse “Nothing was done and you can see had happened another grave tragedy” she said “I don’t want another one to happen” With all his efforts to persuade Bonnici that a public inquiry was unnecessary falling flat Abela concluded the exchange with another approach suggesting that the grieving mother was being manipulated for partisan ends “Whoever is telling you this that a public inquiry is necessary is using your case for partisan purposes” Abela said “With all due respect don’t allow people to capitalise on your plight” Footage Miguela Xuereb
Rosianne Cutajar stripped of committee leadership following Labour ouster,"April 17, 2023 6:40 PM",MP Rosianne Cutajar has been kicked out of Parliament’s Social Committee – which she was chairing – in the first parliamentary sitting that has taken place since her ouster from the Labour Party Katya De Giovanni has been named as the committee’s new chair entitling her to a higher parliamentary honorarium and allowances that Cutajar previously enjoyed De Giovanni was already a member of the committee Randolph Debattista was thus named as Cutajar’s replacement Cutajar had controversially been appointed as chair of the Health Committee on January 2022 just weeks after she received a formal warning by the Standards Committee over the ethics breach related to her role in a property deal involving former Tumas Group CEO Yorgen Fenech which fell through when he was arrested over the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia She was made chair of the Social Committee after the 2022 election Ultimately her ties to Fenech led to her ouster from the Labour Party even though the party initially defended Cutajar when her WhatsApp chats with Fenech were leaked by author Mark Camilleri But amid widespread outrage on the contents of the chats Labour and its leader prime minister Robert Abela changed tack and forced Cutajar out of the party though the MP refused to resign from Parliament and stayed on as an independent MP The motion removing Cutajar from the committee was arguably an inevitable consequence of her ouster from the party and was approved without a vote the government and opposition were in agreement While Monday’s sitting was underway a small group of Occupy Justice activists each wearing pig masks gathered outside Parliament House holding a banner quoting one of the most notorious quotes from the leaked chat Cutajar’s assertion that she would be seeking a wellpaid government consultant because “kulħadd jitħanżer” everyone pigs out One of the activists held a bag with a “Bulgari” label attached recalling an expensive gift that Fenech had bought for the MP Attached to the bag was a tag with the words “From Yors truly” quoting the name Cutajar often used to address Fenech in the chats
Jean Paul Sofia’s mother pleads with MPs to back public inquiry,"April 17, 2023 5:35 PM",The first sitting after Parliament’s Easter recess saw the mother of Jean Paul Sofia personally deliver a letter calling for a public inquiry into her son’s death in the collapse of a Corradino construction site last December to MPs as they entered Parliament House on Monday afternoon Opposition leader Bernard Grech subsequently called for Parliament to urgently discuss the possibility of holding a public inquiry but this request was ultimately turned down by speaker Anġlu Farrugia in line with the objections made by the government In her letter which was accompanied by her son’s memorial card Bonnici emphasised that the past had shown that she could not be satisfied with a magisterial inquiry alone in an apparent reference to previous construction site collapses – including the one that killed Miriam Pace in her own home in 2020 Asked to comment as they received the letter from Bonnici ministers Chris Fearne Jonathan Attard and Byron Camilleri all refused to elaborate stating that they have nothing to add beyond what prime minister Robert Abela had previously said On the other hand Labour MP Randolph Debattista took the time to explain why in his opinion a magisterial inquiry was sufficient in this case insisting that this could even implicate public authorities if they were found not to have fulfilled their duties Bonnici’s letter stressed that her request was not a partisan issue “because when you spend 15 hours waiting so that your son or mother is brought out from the rubble no colour remains but black” But Grech’s request nevertheless saw Ellul cite partisan reasons as he insisted that Parliament should not treat the matter with any urgency Ellul argued that Grech – and presumably Bonnici as a consequence – missed the chance to discuss the matter when an opposition day debate last month was utilised to discuss another bill presented by the opposition which unsuccessfully sought to commit the government to recoup all the funds paid to Vitals and Steward over the hospitals concession cancelled as fraudulent by the courts The opposition had presented a separate motion calling for a public inquiry into Sofia’s death with the express consent of his family “While the government’s parliamentary group shows its compassion to the mother of Jean Paul Sofia the opposition leader had every opportunity to discuss this issue in Parliament… but instead he chose to bring up a subject that the house had already discussed” Ellul said Parliament was suspended for over an hour while speaker Anġlu Farrugia deliberated on the request and he drew on Ellul’s argument concerning the opposition’s failure to make use of the opposition day debate on 16 March He said that precedent suggested that Parliament’s agenda should only be suspended to allow for an urgent debate on an issue that could not afford to wait and there had been no developments indicating that this was the case But Farrugia also claimed that discussing the request for a public inquiry could prejudice the ongoing magisterial inquiry
"Clients call for magisterial inquiry into No Deposit Cars, alleging numerous serious crimes","April 17, 2023 4:40 PM",Former clients of Christian Borg’s company No Deposit Cars are calling on a magistrate to launch a magisterial inquiry into allegations that Borg and his associates have been involved in serious crimes including fraud criminal conspiracy aggravated theft violence stalking money laundering tax evasion and kidnapping The application presented by lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta on behalf of 25 individuals specifically implicates Borg and fellow company representatives Joe Camenzuli Luke Milton Thorne Mangion James Spiteri and Tyson Grech with the applicants stating that they had come to know of crimes carried out by the men including some carried out “in complicity with third parties including public officials that are not yet known” The lawyers’ application is no less than 35 pages long excluding the photographs and other documents presented as evidence and lists numerous crimes alleged to have been carried out by Borg and his associates over the past few years many targeting the company’s own clients The application highlights No Deposit Cars’ controversial practice of installing tracking devices on its leased cars highlighting that this was enabling the company to carry out various crimes against its clients including stalking One client reported that he was driving a tracked vehicle when he was stopped by a car from which three people – including two of the company representatives mentioned above – and forcefully evicted from the vehicle allegedly over late payments Another incident concerns a woman who the lawyers maintained was too afraid to put her name to the application who had acquired a car from the company She was stopped by two foreign men on a tow truck and asked to leave the car and on her refusal the men made off with her number plates Yet another client found that his car had been scratched with the menacing message “try me or pay me” sprayed on leading him to file a police report Ten days later he was driving the car with his wife as passenger when his way was blocked by a car occupied by two men – Borg and Milton with the former said to be wielding a large wooden bat and the latter accused of stealing his keys This the lawyers argued constituted an illegal arrest a crime which is punishable by up to two years’ imprisonment The application also mentions an incident in which Borg and Milton engaged a Serbian man and a Maltese man to kidnap a Maltese young man and force him to sign bills of exchange worth €18000 The youth’s hands were bound and his head covered and he was put in the boot of a car before he was tied to a chair beaten and forced to sign the bills of exchange The application also maintains that a certain No Deposit Cars employee would frequently engage other persons to damage vehicles that had been leased by the company so that the clients concerned would be forced to pay contractual penalties Another crime mentioned in the application reportedly took place just last week and targeted one of the clients who had filed a judicial protest against the company The client concerned was driving his personal car when he was stopped by two men in a car with foreign number plates who warned him “you know what you are doing You stop and we stop” adding that he knew where he and his children lived The client emphasised that since he had no conflicts with anyone else he could not but conclude that the “mafiastyle aggression” was related to his legal dispute with Borg and his company “This is their modus operandi threats and aggression and violence because they feel that no one can stand up to them because they have people covering for them and protecting them at the highest levels of the government” the lawyers said The company was also accused of regularly stealing the cars it sold or leased to clients claiming spurious reasons for repossessing the cars even when clients kept up with the payments The money laundering allegation stems from a claim that Christian Borg would regularly call Tyson Grech up to the Malta International Airport car park after his arrival to Malta Grech would park next to his car and Borg would transfer “four to six” bags – each the size of a large garbage bag – stuffed with cash The lawyers emphasised that there was no doubt that the cash in these bags was much higher than the €10000 that can be carried on overseas trips without declaring the amount to customs According to the application these money transfers have taken place “since at least 2019” and happened on a weekly to twiceweekly basis “The legal presumption is that these are and were funds deriving from criminal activities or the execution of a crime and this is why it is important to launch a magisterial inquiry right away since there are a number of people ready to give statements under oath” the lawyers said

PM flouts parliament rules to react to hospitals report before anyone can read it,"May 15, 2023 6:46 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela was so keen to respond to the National Audit Office’s damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it properly that he chose to openly flout parliamentary procedure to do so Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on a report that appears to be an embarrassment to his government saw him bring it up in Parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon the government rejected its suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In the absence of an agreement Parliament continued with its scheduled debate on the financial estimates of the Environment and Resources Authority while the Nationalist Party scheduled an urgent press conference for 530pm at Parliament House But just as the PN’s press conference was about to begin – in timing that could hardly be considered coincidental – Abela chose to participate in the ERA debate to react to the report In doing so he was clearly out of order and in breach of parliamentary procedure as repeatedly highlighted by PN leader Bernard Grech and other MPs in points of order that they raised But while speaker Anġlu Farrugia accepted that Abela was in breach of procedure Malta’s longestserving speaker proved unable or unwilling to intervene His repeated appeals to Abela fell on deaf ears and Farrugia opted against taking further action While no journalist had been given the opportunity to read the 450page report properly before Abela launched his speech – the report was only made public around an hour earlier – the initial reports by Maltese newsrooms seized on the AuditorGeneral’s conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over a deal with Steward Health Care which obliged the government to pay the company €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled But Abela – who was legal adviser to his predecessor Joseph Muscat when this controversial agreement was reached – made no reference to this or any reference to Mizzi or Muscat at all Instead he focused on a limited defence on what took place when he became PM in 2020 and insisted that he was actually pleased with the findings of the report because for all the problems identified with the concession the report did not identify any misconduct on the part of his own government Consequently he argued he and his government were “serene” even if his insistence on reacting to a report before anyone could actually read it suggested an entirely different scenario Abela also referred to Grech’s decision last week to call on police commissioner Angelo Gafà to investigate him in connection with the hospitals deal insisting that the NAO report made clear that this gambit made no sense as it lacked any credibility As he did so he also drew comparison with a previous criminal complaint targeting his government that made by Repubblika in the wake of the death of a group of asylum seekers in Malta’s searchandrescue area and reports alleging the intentional sabotage of a rubber boat As he had then Abela complained that the PN – he had made no distinction between the party and the activist group three years ago and did not do so on Monday – wanted to send him to prison But in doing so the selfdescribed progressive political leader also reiterated antimigrant rhetoric that would generally be considered to be the preserve of farright politicians describing Malta’s actions in 2020 as a reaction to “increased infections” caused by asylum seekers There is no suggestion that asylum seekers – which are in any case detained at length on arrival through Malta’s controversial detention policy described as “arbitrary” by the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner  – had contributed to the spread of Covid19 or other infections at the time In fact Abela’s government at the time had even taken the unorthodox – and highly questionable from a human rights perspective – step of housing asylum seekers for weeks on end on pleasure boats that were patently unfit for this purpose Abela’s speech predictably derailed the discussion with the next PN MPs to speak taking his cue to disregard the agenda of the day to react to his comments Grech and former PN leader Adrian Delia both described Abela’s actions as an attempt to control the narrative on a scandal before anyone could reasonably read the report The PN leader dismissed the impression Abela sought to portray describing the NAO report as “yet another confirmation that the Labour governments of Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela are accomplices to the greatest fraud this country has ever witnessed” He insisted that Abela’s decision to speak at the same time the PN’s press conference was taken place was a new “abyss” for Abela which testified to the fact that he is “confused weak and compromised” words he has used to describe Abela in recent weeks Grech was also adamant that the air of serenity Abela was seeking to project was a façade and that the PM was clearly preoccupied by the latest developments “He promised continuity” Grech said in reference to remarks Abela nade when he succeeded Muscat as Labour leader and PM “And today we have yet another confirmation that he has delivered it”

Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “criminal association to launder money originating from corruption” Aquilina described it as a “textbook case of money laundering” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country” “From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “remained silent and has not denied anything”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"Court lifts injunction, paving way for spring hunting of turtle doves","April 17, 2023 12:15 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The government is free to open a spring hunting season for the European turtle dove after a judge revoked an injunction sought by BirdLife Malta that he had provisionally upheld The ruling by judge Giovanni Grixti comes on the same day in which the spring hunting season was set to open paving the way for the government to issue a legal notice seeking a derogation from the EU’s Birds Directive to allow the spring hunting of a species that is considered to be vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature The reasoning Malta has used to justify this derogation has failed to impress the European Commission which launched fresh infringement proceedings after the government fulfilled a preelection promise to end a moratorium on the spring hunting of turtle doves last year but these procedures – which could see Malta fined by the Commission if confirmed to have been in breach of EU laws – ultimately had no bearing on the court’s decision It is the vulnerable status of the turtle doves whose numbers have declined considerably over the past decades – with habitat loss and hunting considered to be the main culprits – that was cited by BirdLife in its application for an injunction which was signed by lawyers Claire Bonello and Martin Farrugia The FKNK hunters’ federation had unsuccessfully applied to be a party to the case but predictably celebrated its outcome on Monday 17 April 2023 insisting that it “is satisfied once again justice has reigned” and wishing its members a fruitful hunting season

FIAU acting director unsuited to role due to record on Pilatus Bank – ADPD,"April 17, 2023 10:16 AM",ADPD – the Green Party – is maintaining that the newlyappointed acting director of the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit is unsuited to the task given his role in certifying Pilatus Bank as Alfred Zammit who was the FIAU’s deputy director became its acting director earlier this month following the departure of Kenneth Farrugia who has been appointed as the new CEO of the Malta Financial Services Authority But the party questioned how Zammit’s appointment could be considered appropriate since back in 2016 he certified that Pilatus Bank would be able to continue its banking operations despite the identification of various deficiencies when its compliance with antimoney laundering regulations was considered The bank had it licence withdrawn in 2018 and a record fine of almost €5 million was imposed A magisterial inquiry subsequently recommended the initiation criminal proceedings against its top officials – only for the Malta Police Force and the Office of the Attorney General to refuse to following suit prosecuting only one individual to date The authorities have been deemed to have carried out a coverup in favour of various officials – particularly risk manager Antoniella Gauci – in a book published on Saturday by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina titled “Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe” In light of Zammit’s record ADPD chairperson Carmel Cacopardo argued that Malta was still rebuilding its reputation in financial services and could not afford to rest on its laurels just because it had succeeded in being removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list “In such circumstances the appointment as head of the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit FIAU – albeit temporarily – of the person thanks to whom Pilatus Bank was allowed to continue its operations in Malta is an irresponsible act” he insisted “The fact that we are no longer greylisted is not enough to remove any stains on the reputation of our country Such appointments still leave visible stains on Malta’s reputation as the person currently leading the FIAU does not inspire the muchneeded trust in this sector” he concluded

Cause for sainthood of M.Teresa Nuzzo advances on centenary of her death,"April 17, 2023 9:04 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti On the centenary of her death the canonisation process of Mother MTeresa Nuzzo is reaching an important milestone the positive conclusion of the diocesan investigation into her life Nuzzo who was born in Valletta on 11 May 1851 took private vows of poverty chastity and obedience as a young woman but formed part of no religious order – her spiritual director Mgr Pietro Pace who served as Bishop of Gozo between 1877 and 1889 and subsequently Bishop of Malta until his death in 1914 maintained that she was not suited for the cloister She subsequently set out to establish a religious order of sisters and fulfilled her dream when she officially founded the congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart in Ħamrun on 21 November 1903 The order she founded now has a presence in four continents Nuzzo died on 17 April 1923 and the order’s first efforts to lead to her canonisation began in 1955 when the order’s superior general Sr Scholastica Dimech asked Archbishop Michael Gonzi for permission to transfer Nuzzo’s remains from the Addolorata Ceremony to the Nuzzo Institute in Ħamrun Another superior general of the order Sr Ermellina Mifsud also worked to prepare for the canonisation of its founder appointing a commission that worked to gather evidence on Nuzzo’s life led by the Discalced Carmelite friar Aluigi Pisani to ensure that evidence could be gathered from her contemporaries before they passed away In 1987 Archbishop Joseph Mercieca accepted the appointment of Fr Anthony Sciberras MSSP as postulator – the person who guides the cause for beatification or canonisation through the Church’s judicial processes – and the testimony could now start to be heard in an official matter Fr Sciberras served in this role until 2002 when on his suggestion and on the invitation of thensuperior general Sr Catherine Seychell the mantle was passed on to Mgr Charles Scicluna the present Archbishop with Fr Sciberras continuing to serve as his deputy On 18 February 2003 through a decree of Cardinal José Saravia Martins – then the prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints – sent to Archbishop Mercieca the nihil obstat certificate declaring Nuzzo as a Servant of God thus officially declaring her as a candidate for sainthood In 2018 Fr Luis Escalante became the new postulator on the request of the order’s present superior general Sr Pauline Farrugia and he holds the post to this day The vicepostulator at present is a member of the order Nuzzo founded Sr Leena Castellino And 5 years later on the centenary of her death this diocesan process has led to the conclusion desired by Nuzzo’s devotees the conviction that Nuzzo has led a life of heroic virtue The commission advancing her cause also confirmed the extent of the devotion to the founder of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart in Malta and overseas The closure of the diocesan process is set to be formally announced on Monday leading to the continuation of her canonization process at the Holy See A miracle will have to be confirmed before Nuzzo can be beatified and while the commission advancing her cause has heard many people testify to graces received through her intercession no case has yet been accepted as a miracle The Daughters of the Sacred Heart are encouraging the faithful to seek her intercession and expressing their hope that God will permit miracles to take place through her intercession so that the cause for her sainthood can reach its culmination
Prison bars correctional officer behind Hitler book from contact with inmates,"April 17, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Ronald Bugeja has been provisionally barred from having any contact with inmates at the Correctional Corradino Facility after the outrage caused by his writing of a book that speaks favourably of Adolf Hitler – and a TV appearance in which his views were left unchallenged A spokesperson of the Correctional Services Agency CSA confirmed to Newsbookcommt that “as a preventive measure all contact with inmates has been removed” after highlighting that Bugeja already had limited contact with inmates since he was responsible for infrastructural projects The preventive measure suggests an investigation into the matter is underway though the agency did not elaborate Bugeja was interviewed on a book bearing the title “Mein Führer Adolf Hitler LIstorja u lBijografija” and other works of his on the 23 March edition of Ħajjitna Ktieb a TVM programme hosted by veteran presenter John Demanuele The broadcast fell under the radar until activist and blogger Manuel Delia came across the book – and the TV appearance – in recent days and demanded that the Public Broadcasting Authorities editorial board take responsibility and resign The programme was still available on demand until it was pulled from the TVMi website on Friday morning as the controversy raged Hours later PBS acknowledged that editorial rules had clearly been breached and said that it had launched an investigation into how this had happened and on why the broadcast did not appear to have gone through editorial scrutiny or quality control The producers and presenter of the programme were told that they were being deemed to be in serious breach of their contract Demanuele also issued an apology albeit one made towards “whoever felt offended” and which justified his failure to challenge Bugeja’s apologias for Hitler on the basis that the programme aims to give authors the opportunity to air their views and not serve as a platform for the presenter’s opinions But reports that Bugeja was employed at the Correctional Services Facility – Newsbookcommt subsequently confirmed that he holds the rank of correctional inspector effectively a managerial rank – raised other concerns given the potential issues that can arise from prison staff holding extremist views Consequently the newsroom sought comments from both the CSA which runs the prison and the home affairs minister politically responsible for it Both sent their replies within hours on the weekend within minutes of one another in what appears to attest to the priority being given to address an issue of great controversy that could not be left unaddressed In response to Newsbookcommt’s questions the CSA emphasised that it “is unequivocally against any views that portray a racist or farright ideology” and that it “strives to work towards a rehabilitated environment that goes beyond ethnicity gender religion and sexuality” It also said that the views expressed by Bugeja were expressed “solely in his personal capacity as an author and do not reflect the views of the agency” However the newsroom’s query whether Bugeja was required to seek clearance under the Public Service Management Code before appearing on TV and whether this clearance was provided was not conclusively addressed The Home Affairs Ministry showed apparent satisfaction with the CSA’s reaction with its spokesperson matteroffactly stating that minister Byron Camilleri was informed that the agency took immediate action But while Camilleri was confirmed to have “not watched the TV interview nor read the book and neither intends to do so” the ministry nevertheless said that all that he had read on the matter was enough for him to draw a key conclusion “His views are totally different from those reportedly expressed by the author” the ministry said
‘We will get there;’ activists hold 66th monthly vigil for Daphne,"April 16, 2023 9:02 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A huge banner declaring “we will get there” served as the backdrop of the 66th monthly vigil commemorating Daphne Caruana Galizia with the activists behind the event sounding a hopeful note about the prospect of justice and the whole truth coming out The vigil has been held without fail marking every month since the assassination of Caruana Galizia on 16 October 2017 and Sunday’s vigil came a day after the publication of a damning exposé by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina bearing the title “Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe” The three women who addressed the crowd – Occupy Justice activists Becky d’Ugo and Paula Fleri Soler and Repubblika activist Vicki Ann Cremona – all referred to the book as they did so D’Ugo who compered the event apologised for looking tired highlighting that she spent much of the night poring through Aquilina’s “extraordinary work” “I love reading horror stories but what I was reading scared me more than ghosts and apparitions because I was seeing the facts” she said “I hope that many others lost sleep last night some because they kept reading and others because what they read or heard made them fear that finally the truth will come out that the resignations that should long have happened are imminent and that they cannot evade the prison sentences they deserve for ever” d’Ugo continued “The government or state institutions are no place for the corrupt they belong in jail” As always the vigil is held in front of the Great Siege memorial which has served as a memorial for Daphne since her assassination – despite the government clearing the tributes to the slain journalist hundreds of time in behaviour that saw a court declare that minister Owen Bonnici had breached activists’ human rights In her address FleriSoler drew quick comparisons between these clearups and the decision to remove a photo of JeanPaul Sofia – the 20yearold killed in a construction site collapse last December – placed by his grieving mother on the Castille lawn No one has claimed responsibility for this clearing and activists restored the picture the following day “Are we back to these shenanigans again” FleriSoler asked questioning whether “the minister for breaching human rights” was responsible “Perhaps he is too busy troubleshooting the fact that a Nazi sympathiser was allowed to spew his venom on the national TV station” she said referring to the controversial TV appearance by correctional officer Ronald Bugeja who authored a book titled “Mein Führer Adolf Hitler LIstorja u lBijografija” FleriSoler used much of her speech to list numerous scandals and controversies preceding each with a “lest we forget” But she emphasised that her long list was but a few “randomly chosen” cases which represented “a handful of the hundreds of stories of corruption abuse of power flagrant disregard for rule of law and an environment of impunity that the government has implemented for its cronies” She segued this with the last of many utterances “lest we forget” in her speech “Lest we forget about all of this Daphne was right” Cremona’s own speech was in a largely similar vein highlighting the government’s clear inaction in the face of corruption in the face of the prime minister’s repeated insistence that the “institutions” are working “The institutions are so blinded by corruption that they don’t even remember what their job truly is” she said “All they know is to apply different weights and measures when dealing with the powerful and the weak” She highlighted that the police who slept on countless serious cases found no compunction with targeting the four students who exposed grave security vulnerabilities in the FreeHour app condemning the company for calling the police and the police for their excessive response – which included strip searches “If only the police stripsearched Keith Schembri when they arrested him perhaps they would have found his missing mobile phone perhaps hidden inside an intimate part of his body I do not wish to elaborate on” she quipped She similarly decried the harsh response to the three youths known as the El Hiblu 3 whose efforts to mediate between the group of asylum seekers they formed part of and the Libyan boat that rescued them saw Malta charge them with hijacking She highlighted that the police failed to seek the testimony of any other asylum seekers on the boat knowing all too well that their testimony would prove the trio’s innocence and that this failure could potentially see the youths face life imprisonment – simply because their knowledge of English allowed them to act as interpreters Cremona also mentioned the controversy concerning Bugeja’s TV appearance to promote his book and insisted that if the public broadcaster had any decency they would waste no time in inviting Robert Aquilina to speak about his book on Pilatus “Because these are the books and stories that should be aired on public broadcasting not the trash and the partial or fake news that they force us to watch” she concluded
Bail denied for Rabat kidnap suspect over alleged attempt to corrupt witness,"April 16, 2023 7:19 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti One of the 6 men out on bail over the alleged abduction of a man – a group that notably includes Christian Borg a beneficiary of numerous public contracts – is back behind bars after being denied bail over a separate case the alleged attempt to corrupt a witness 21yearold Bormla resident Burton Azzopardi was implicated in relation to criminal proceedings against his younger brother Earlier in the week 19yearold Zven Azzopardi was accused of attempting to run over a mechanic and pointing a gun at him amid a dispute on a repair job he had carried out The younger Azzopardi had been denied bail after pleading not guilty to the charges and Burton has now followed suit after being charged with attempting to corrupt a witness breaching bail conditions and recidivism No details about the case emerged during the arraignment on Sunday but it is understood that Burton Azzopardi approached the mechanic and attempted to persuade him not to testify against his brother Azzopardi replied with a flippant “ħeqq” when asked what he was pleading legal aid lawyer Martin Farrugia subsequently entered a not guilty plea and requested bail Prosecuting inspector Gabriel Kitcher objected citing concerns that Azzopardi would continue approaching and attempting to intimidate the witness who is now set to testify against both Azzopardi brothers The prosecution’s reasoning was readily accepted by the court which denied bail due to the risk of evidence being tampered with
Ex-AFM soldier claims government orders prevent migrant rescues,"April 16, 2023 6:45 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A former Armed Forces of Malta soldier has claimed to Italian media that Malta has directed its forces not to rescue migrants in difficulty as the Italian government and sections of the country’s media continue to criticise Malta for its apparent unwillingness to do its part Just a few days ago Tommaso Foti the parliamentary leader of the rightwing Fratelli d’Italia party headed by Italy’s PM Giorgia Meloni accused Malta of “pretending not to see” people at sea a charge that was denied by the Maltese authorities But similar claims have also long been made by NGOs involved in the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea whose work has drawn the ire – and even sensational accusations of collusion with human traffickers – of both Malta and Italy The same accusation has now been made through a feature on TGCOM 24 a news service run by Mediaset the media empire founded by Silvio Berlusconi whose own Forza Italia party is a junior partner in Meloni’s coalition government TGCOM 24 journalist Alessio Fusco spoke to a former member of the AFM’s Maritime Squadron who declared that few migrants were landing in Malta because the authorities were specifically directing the AFM not to rescue them He said that Malta dispatched patrol boats that seek to follow boats on their way to Sicily – primarily either the island of Lampedusa or the port of Porto Empedocle – so that they can be “lost in Europe” The Italian newsroom also aired a recording of a purported excerpt of a phone call made by NGO SeaWatch to the AFM in which a Maltese officer tells them “I am sorry we don’t not speak with NGOs” before hanging up the phone Fusco’s feature also took aim at conditions in the Ħal Far detention centres and open centres questioning how the considerable funding Malta received to support its reception of asylum seekers was being spent The journalist also interviewed aditus foundation director Neil Falzon who suggested that the EU found Malta’s hardline stance all too convenient
"Sudan war: Sudanese in Malta should be given protection, activist says","May 16, 2023 7:00 AM",Videos Miguela Xuereb Sudanese nationals in Malta should be granted some form of protection Hadia Bashir said as she urged the authorities to take action and offer these asylum seekers with some stability Bashir a former politician in Sudan sat down with Newsbookcommt to reflect on the situation in her country after intense clashes between Sudan’s military and country’s main paramilitary force erupted in midApril The clashes saw hundreds of people killed whilst thousands fled the country amid the power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime which has its roots before the 30year dictatorial rule of Omar Al Bashir was brought to an end in 2019 The Sudanese armed forces are broadly loyal to General Abdel Fattah alBurhan the country’s de facto ruler The paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces RSF are a collection of militia under the command of a former warlord General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemediti The RSF also known as Janjaweed was founded by Al Bashir to crush a rebellion in Darfur that began more than 20 years ago It was then transformed into a semiorganised paramilitary force by Al Bashir in 2013 with their leaders being deployed in South Sudan to crush a rebellion In 2019 RSF together with the Sudanese Armed Forces cooperated to oust Al Bashir However efforts to transition to a democratic civilianled government fell through following a coup in October 2021 Speaking to Newsbookcommt Bashir explained that the majority of the Sudanese in Malta are asylum seekers who are seeking for protection “It is now evident why they need protection” Bashir said as she insisted that by offering them some stability the Sudanese in Malta can feel safe and can also help their families back in Sudan “Applications for protection by Sudanese are usually rejected In our community we have a large number of Sudanese whose application has been rejected They are from Darfur and would have moved to Khartoum Now you can see how they are suffering” she said “They should be given some form of protection even temporary protection – it is better than nothing at all” Bashir underlined Describing Sudan as a rich country Bashir reminisced that the people were hopeful after the Al Bashir regime collapsed in 2019 following a 30year dictatorial rule “The hands of Al Bashir are still there” she said and noted that the democratic transition faltered Like diplomats in Khartoum who warned in early 2022 that violence would eventually break out the people of Sudan were expecting something to happen Asked if foreign nations could be involved in what was taking place Bashir said she could not accuse anyone adding that Sudanese suspect the involvement of third parties however it is not yet visible Whilst comparisons are odious the situation in Sudan was compared to the invasion of Ukraine with Bashir describing it “worse” since her conationals were being killed by Sudanese themselves “It is a real disaster Dead bodies on the roads looting and the hospitals are not functioning” she explained Moreover bordering countries are not safe “The countries are not 100 safe and people are waiting for help at the border” she said Bashir also added that there is hardly any media presence in the country documenting what is happening The Sudanese community in Malta is quite sizeable with the members having family back home The clashes brought with them internet outages making it difficult for Sudanese in Malta to reach out to their relatives back home A Sudanese in Malta had five of his family members killed during the clashes The former politician underlined that it was important that the general public in Malta to be aware of what is happening in Sudan “They need to know what is happening in our country and pray for the people in danger” Bashir said and added that Sudan also needed humanitarian assistance “There are organisations that moved in to assist the people in Turkey and Syria now the Sudanese need the same things we would be very grateful if they help out” she said Speaking about her political stint in Sudan Bashir said it was hard to be a woman and a politician representing the opposition party Among the five people elected she was the only woman representing women in the Red Sea state for five years “As a parliament member in an Opposition party you are not protected” Bashir recalled adding that one could easily be jailed because of a differing political opinion However she feels she delivered her message while in office Watch the full interview below

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"God forgives, but sometimes we do not forgive ourselves – Archbishop","April 16, 2023 5:42 PM",Archbishop Charles Scicluna urged the faithful to learn how to forgive themselves – and one another – as he celebrated mass on Sunday The Catholic Church observes Divine Mercy Sunday a week after Easter and appropriately the Archbishop’s mass was celebrated at the Divine Mercy Sanctuary in Naxxar The devotion to the Divine Mercy originated from the Polish religious sister St Faustina Kowalska who was canonised by her compatriot St John Paul II in 2000 who officially designated the Second Sunday of Easter as Divine Mercy Sunday In 2002 the late pope had also declared that a plenary indulgence can be obtained by going to church on Divine Mercy Sunday “in a spirit that is completely detached from the affection for a sin” and by participating in prayers held in honour of the Divine Mercy In light of his active promotion of this devotion the late pope’s own beatification and canonisation both came on a Divine Mercy Sunday in 2011 and 2014 respectively In his homily the Archbishop recalled that St John Paul II had encouraged the faithful to go to confession on the day and addressed those who may have reservations about doing so Mgr Scicluna highlighted that while the priest hearing confession is not himself free of sin the power of absolution “does not come from the priest’s sweet countenance but through the power of Jesus Christ” Even members of the clergy – himself included – needed to confess their own sins to another priest he emphasised “I cannot just confess while staring at the mirror – that would be too convenient as you can tell the mirror anything you wish It is a little harder to tell the same things to a priest” he observed He recalled how he was impressed by a Catholic who answered that that his faith held firm – in spite of all the imperfections and defects that may be found within the Church – because of the power to absolve sins “The Lord has given us this certainty that when the priest tells you those simple words – ‘I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit’ – our sins are forgiven” the Archbishop continued “But my suggestion would be let us learn to forgive our own sins and forgive one another because experience shows that God may forgive but sometimes we cannot forgive ourselves Or we are not capable of forgiving one another” He recalled an observation that Pope Francis is fond of making that God does not tire of forgiving people’s sins but people do get tired of asking for forgiveness as he encouraged the faithful not to give up just because they have made a mistake yet again “God through his priests is always ready to forgive you” he added In this spirit he concluded his homily by inviting the faithful to seek the sacraments that Jesus established as a form of communion with him Confession and the Eucharist with an eye to those who were following the service online or on TV Noting that he could neither confess nor administer the Eucharist via television he encouraged the faithful following on TVs or computer to join the Christian community in person whenever possible “May today’s holy mystery persuade us how good and holy this would be” he concluded
Sant warns Labour not to ignore corruption and patronage,"April 16, 2023 5:34 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Former prime minister Alfred Sant used the platform he was provided in the closing of the Labour Party’s general conference to warn the party he once led to resist corruption in all its forms and not to sweep problems under the rug Sant now an MEP – though he has confirmed that he will not contest next year’s EP elections – insisted that Labour should make sure that there is “no room for friendships and patronage because no one is bigger than the party and nothing is bigger than the country” The former PM warned that Labour should not get tripped up in its success and succumb to the temptation of bribery and corruption adding that politics should not be seen as a career move but a platform to fulfil one’s ideals He also insisted that Labour should avoid the mistakes made by the Nationalist Party in government ignoring or denying the existence of such a problem While prime minister Robert Abela has long studiously avoided even mentioning his predecessor Joseph Muscat by name Sant had no compunction with mentioning the man who succeeded him as Labour Party leader in 2008 describing him as a “good friend” that “gave a future to the small the weak and the working class” and earning applause from attendees Sant also emphasised the importance of addressing other challenges faced by the government including the cost of living to which he tied Malta’s growing dependence on lowincome workers Moreover Malta faced the possibility of disastrous consequences from climate change which required sacrifices and significant changes to address as well as the prospect of a common tax base which would dent Malta’s lowtax regime On the latter Sant highlighted that other EU countries were fed up by the wealthy using Malta to avoid tax – and that they were right to feel this way
"‘You are a coward, weak and compromised,’ Bernard Grech tells PM","April 16, 2023 2:48 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech did not hold back in his descriptions of prime minister Robert Abela in a political event on Sunday morning reserving a number of lessthancomplimentary remarks for the Labour Party leader And Grech’s speech saw him invoke no less than former PM and Labour leader Dom Mintoff in spite of the politician’s lessthanstellar reputation among his audience “How would Mintoff react to the betrayal of the workers the party should be working for” he asked A key example of this betrayal in Grech’s view is the planned closure of Air Malta as revealed by The Shift which contrasted with the airline’s decision to continue advertising job opportunities giving workers the impression of a chance to improve their position without telling them that they face layoffs a few months down the line But Grech also spoke at length about a cause his party has made its own a demand for a public inquiry by the family of Jean Paul Sofia the 20yearold youth who was killed in the collapse of a factory under construction in Corradino He dismissed Abela’s decision to send a letter to the chief justice urging him to get the inquiring magistrate to bring her inquiry to a quick close – no such letter was sent to the police over their failure to prosecute anyone in contrast – as a gimmick “Robert Abela sent this letter because he is a courage because he knows that the chief justice cannot publicly respond to it” he said It was one of numerous occasions in which he dismissed the PM as a coward with the next happening within a minute as he highlighted that people of all political persuasions were perplexed by Abela’s refusal not to hold a public inquiry since there would be no problem with such a process if there was nothing to hide “But he doesn’t do it because he has something to hide” Grech added “Because Robert Abela you are a coward you are weak and you are compromised” Grech also referred to the exposé on the Pilatus Bank investigations published by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina focusing particularly on the police’s and the attorney general’s efforts to spare Antoniella Gauci from criminal consequences at all costs – and the revelation that her family appeared to enjoyed close links with Abela himself “And then he tells us to let the institutions work of course he lets them be when they carry out a coverup to protect him” he exclaimed adding that what he expected instead was that Abela demand the resignation of both the police commissioner and the attorney general “If you are a criminal if you are a suspect if you have wealth or power you have Robert Abela on your side” he later said “But if you are not powerful are a worker or if you want justice then only the Nationalist Party can help” he said Grech also repeatedly insisted that Abela’s government had no vision or ambition to speak of and took inspiration from a viral video showing a Fgura crossroads with four noentry signs legally preventing vehicles entering it from leaving it “This is the situation the government of Robert Abela finds itself in at a crossroads with no idea where to go” he said “This is the state of the country under your rule You have no ideas no solutions no ability and no vision you only have words and millions in public funds you are only too happy to waste”
Church reiterates full support for monument commemorating 1961 interdict,"April 16, 2023 1:56 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Archdiocese of Malta has reiterated that it fully supports the erection of a monument honouring those who were affected by the 1961 interdict against the Malta Labour Party expressing its disappointment with claims to the contrary published on Sunday’s edition of ItTorċa A frontpage article which appears to rely solely on information provided by veteran Labour activist and Valletta Cultural Agency chair Jason Micallef lamented that there had been “three years of silence” on the matter after former minister José Herrera suggested that the monument could be placed in the garden of the Archbishop’s Palace But Archbishop Charles Scicluna had actually replied to this suggestion back in 18 May 2020 emphasising that in a spirit of national unity the Church was in favour of the erection of such a monument However it was not convinced by the proposed location since the Archbishop’s Palace houses the Church’s Ecclesiastical Tribunal which handles delicate matrimonial cases The Archdiocese did not wish to risk compromising the high degree of confidentiality these procedures required The Archdiocese thus suggested that the memorial should be hosted in a public and prominent space and to this effect welcomed Herrera’s subsequent proposals to erect the monument at the Mall Gardens in Floriana But the Archdiocese has never received a reply to this letter which was sent on 18 May 2020 and which it is making public any threeyear silence has been from the government’s end However it “continues to welcome the proposal with open arms and is fully supportive of such an initiative as well as any initiative for a monument dedicated to all victims of physical and moral violence both by the Church and the State” The Archdiocese also recalled that on 2 November 2019 the Archbishop had blessed the tombs at the previously unconsecrated area of the Addolorata Cemetery known as the Miżbla including the tomb of the most senior MLP official buried within the author and former deputy PM Ġuzè Ellul Mercer On that occasion Archbishop Scicluna also followed the example set by his predecessors Michael Gonzi Joseph Mercieca and Paul Cremona and asked for forgiveness for the Church’s actions at that period in history
"‘Stick to books and blogs as we continue to lead,’ Abela says after Pilatus exposé","April 16, 2023 12:15 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Labour leader Robert Abela did not directly react to a new publication by anticorruption activist Robert Aquilina in which he released previously unpublished court documents emails and reports including a 400page independent financial investigation on the now defunct bank Pilatus Bank but instead addressed his critics and said “stick to books and blogs whilst we continue to lead” Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe gives an account of the setting up of the bank in 2013 by Iranian businessman Ali Hasheminejad and how investigations into reports of money laundering by the bank were ‘covered up’ It also includes previously unpublished emails which show that the police and attorney general Victoria Buttigieg decided first not to prosecute Pilatus officials and then worked backwards to justify their decision Speaking for the first time in public after the book was published Abela did not address a hypothesis that the bank’s former risk manager Antoniella Gauci may have been shielded from prosecution due to his personal ties with her family and instead said “stick to books and blogs which you enjoy dabbling with whilst we will reply by creating more jobs and generating wealth for the people” He urged those present not to be afraid of criticism and insisted that the government has to take decisions and accused the opposition of wanting to stall the country “I won’t let that happen irrespective of the decisions I need to take” he said Accusing his adversaries that they “lack” ideas and “initiatives” Abela said the opposition “wants to sow fear and stop the country from moving forward” Similarly the Office of the Prime Minister did not deny that Gauci the daughter of a former client and a canvasser of Abela benefitted from a nolle prosequi which means she will not face criminal charges over her role in Pilatus Bank During his Sunday speech at the Labour’s General Conference Abela also spoke about tourism but did not refer to reports that the national airline will be dissolved by the end of year as the European Commission has informally told the government that state aid to the ailing airline will not be approved

Only 4% of hunters actually report what they hunt – BirdLife CEO,"April 16, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The executive head of eNGO BirdLife Malta Mark Sultana has stated that only 4 of hunters in the country actually report whatever they hunt He said this during a debate with Gerald Vella a member of the hunting lobby group FKNK during the programme Andrew Azzopardi on 103 Intending to debunk the FKNK’s argument that the turtledove does not lay its eggs in Malta but heads north to do so Sultana said that the turtledove is not allowed to lay its eggs when hunters shoot them down in the first place In fact spring hunting is particularly harmful for the bird as it passes over Malta while it heads to Europe to breed after having spent the winter season in the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert Hunting this bird during spring means that it is unable to procreate putting this species at risk Sultana explained that every year the number of turtledoves is swindling There are several reasons for this he said one of them being unstainable hunting “It is not the FKNK’s fault that this is happening but spring hunting is certainly contributing to this decline” he said noting that the FKNK does not deny that the turtledove is indeed vulnerable Vella responded saying that not every person who goes hunting shoots down birds until the last day of the season He claimed that the FKNK and BirdLife’s work is actually similar and their aims are often the same Vella noted that hunters must abide by many regulations and limitations that have been imposed on them over the past few years including certain distances they must keep and reports they must make while hunting He then clarified that this is all beneficial “Before BirdLife accepts that Maltese hunters have a right to hunt just like hunters abroad we will not make any progress” Vella insisted Asked about the NGO’s action where they placed a dead turtledove outside Castille which was heavily criticized by the San Ubertu Hunters KSU Sultana explained that the action was intended to show that the bird was killed illegally in a country that shows no respect for birds He said that while he is sure that members of the FKNK do not break the law there is still no respect for the threatened species Vella retorted saying that this was only an allegation and that while the law was breached when the pigeon was killed the law was also breached when BirdLife placed the pigeon outside Castille Regarding the prohibitory injunction filed by BirdLife Sultana said that the NGO’s arguments are based on a scientific study that clearly shows that the turtledove is a threatened species and that the opening of this season will threaten its future He stressed that the FKNK and the Government are using the derogation of the European Commission of 2009 to justify the opening of the spring hunting season He added that since the moratorium on spring hunting was requested by the FKNK itself the species has become more vulnerable Vella countered that the FKNK requested the moratorium because “it cares about the turtledove” Thus when the species is hunted the hunters know that it is sustainable

Konrad Mizzi dismisses NAO report as ‘blatantly false’,"May 15, 2023 8:09 PM",Former Labour minister Konrad Mizzi dismissed the damning National Audit Report which concluded that he had misled the Cabinet of ministers over the hospitals concession deal as “pure conjecture irresponsible and blatantly false” Mizzi’s tirade against the NAO comes despite his refusal to cooperate with the investigation with the report saying that the former minister’s failure to cooperate was “inexcusable” The report concluded that Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” However in a Facebook post on Monday Mizzi denied this and insisted that Cabinet held lengthy discussion at various stages of the concession deal “Some context is necessary On the 26th August 2019 I had briefed Cabinet that terms for credit facilities from BOV were discussed and that BOV was seeking additional safeguards The memorandum to Cabinet clearly stated that in the event of a court declaration of nullity of the concession government would become liable to pay the lender’s debt and would trigger a government event of default” Mizzi claimed He added that this was deemed necessary following discussions with the Ministry of Finance Bank of Valletta and other stakeholders “Lengthy discussions took place in Cabinet on the implications of both lender’s debt and a government’s event of default and I answered all questions raised by my peers as the then Prime Minister who chaired the meeting himself confirms” he said in reference to Joseph Muscat Muscat himself had attempted to shift blame of the deal which court said is fraudulent on to his ministers Reacting to the court judgment in February Muscat claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and decisions by the Cabinet However former minister Evarist Bartolo refuted Muscat’s claims and said ”Following comments about the cabinet in reaction to the court’s ruling on the hospital’s deal with foreign companies is it fair to use the cabinet as a smokescreen” Bartolo also told Times of Malta that the hospital deal details were not discussed in Cabinet and “the devil is in the details” Moreover the court judgment which annulled the concessions pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country

OPM does not deny that daughter of Abela’s client and canvasser got a nolle prosequi,"April 15, 2023 3:20 PM",The Office of the Prime Minister has not denied that the daughter of a former client and canvasser to prime minister Robert Abela was given a nolle prosequi and instead insisted that the “institutions are functioning” The statement comes after anticorruption activist Robert Aquilina published a book titled ‘Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe’ which builds on months of his and Repubblika’s investigations into the case and on the various sources who have provided inside information on how the authorities responded to this claims In his new book Aquilina publishes internal police correspondence which shows how the police’s top brass had worked backwards to justify a foregone conclusion not to prosecute former risk manager at the nowdefunct Pilatus Bank Antoniella Gauci The emails date to July 2021 Abela had already become prime minister by then Gauci is the daughter of a canvasser to Robert Abela Court records also show that Abela served as the Gauci’s family lawyer in at least two cases between 2009 and 2015 In its statement the OPM said the institutions are “functioning independently and autonomously and take their decisions empowered at law” However the statement did not address why the authorities sought to protect Gauci including the hypothesis that it may be due to Abela’s personal ties to her family The government in its statement said the administration led by Abela “gave tools to the institutions to fulfil their duties as well as empowered citizens so that they are able to contest the said decisions” The OPM was referring to the introduction of Article 469B in the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure in 2020 which allows for a judicial review of a decision of the Attorney General This type of proceeding allows a judge to review the lawfulness of a decision or an action made by the Attorney General However the court may at most declare the decision null and void but it cannot substitute its discretion for that of the public authority So even in the event that the decision not to prosecute is declared null and void the court cannot order the AG to prosecute Pilatus Bank’s top brass as recommended in the 600000page inquiry Repubblika had filed challenge proceedings against Gafà for the alleged offences which are still fall within the police’s responsibility to prosecute and a judicial review action for those offences which fall under the AG’s responsibility After both the police and the AG failed to take the action recommended in the report To date only charged the bank and money laundering reporting officer Claudanne SantFournier despite having issued international arrest warrants for Tasli and other foreign officials The case against the two is ongoing and they deny the charges Almost a year after the challenge proceedings were filed the case has been stalled since presiding magistrate Nadine Lia refused to withdraw from hearing the case and Repubblika had no other option but to take its case before the Constitutional Court
Commissioner Fantozzi will not arraign any politicians – Cassola,"April 15, 2023 2:53 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Independent candidate Arnold Cassola has claimed that the problem with the investigation into the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia is that “we have Commissioner Fantozzi as Police Commissioner” Speaking on the programme Andrew Azzopardi on 103 Cassola likened Police Commissioner Angelo Gafà to the Italian fictional character of Ugo Fantozzi an inept mediocre man who has an aptitude for psychological subjection to power The independent candidate said that the current Police Commissioner is covering up for certain people and is not charging the persons he should be taking to Court Speaking on Keith Schembri Cassola said that the proof is there He recalled how Schembri tried to implicate former PL minister Chris Cardona and Darren Debono in Daphne’s murder Cassola said that this was to deviate the attention from Yorgen Fenech “Keith Schembri has never filed a libel case against me I hope to God that he does so” Cassola said Asked about the efforts made by Prime Minister Robert Abela when he replaced the Police Commissioner and the Attorney General Cassola said that these were cosmetic changes “He appointed an even worse Police Commissioner and Attorney General” he said referring to Gafà and Victoria Buttigieg With regards to the public inquiry into construction victim Jean Paul Sofia’s death Cassola said that for some reason Prime Minister Abela is scared of opening it because the problems with the current construction laws will come to the surface “The public inquiry would establish the ins and outs of how two criminals were handed public land by the State and how they were allowed to build on it illegally Abela must tell us why he does not want to open the inquiry” Cassola said Prime Minister Abela has brushed off several appeals to open an inquiry into Sofia’s death including by Sofia’s mother claiming that it would obstruct the course of justice
Air Malta to close by end of year – report,"April 15, 2023 12:26 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Air Malta will be dissolved by the end of this year The Shift News revealed on Saturday morning The investigative news outlet reported that millions of euros will be used to pay redundancy and severance packages while the plan is to dissolve the national airline and replace it with a more commercially viable airline Quoting sources The Shift reported that the European Commission has informally told the government that the €290 million in state aid sought for Air Malta would not get approved and the discussions have now shifted to focusing on how the transition to a new airline can be made without breaching the EU’s strict state aid rules The government sought the Commission’s approval in 2020 The government is considering adopting Alitalia’s transformation to ITA as an option to close down the airline sources told the online news outlet According to the report Air Malta’s dissolution will be finalised by the end of year and this will make the airline’s staff redundant As a result the government will have to fork out tens of millions of euros in severance packages according to their collective agreements The Shift had already revealed that if the government does not receive the greenlight from Brussels it would close down the national airline The Nationalist Party has reacted to the revelation saying that the Government should be transparent with the public about the future of Air Malta and put people’s minds at rest In a statement party spokespersons Ivan Castillo Mario De Marco and Ivan J Bartolo stated that the Government’s silence creates nothing but uncertainty in the minds of many who will be hit hard by the decision particularly employees and their families as well as anyone working in the tourism industry “The Maltese and Gozitan people expect the Government of Robert Abela to be transparent and honest about the future of the national airline as is its clear duty” the spokespersons said

Repubblika president sheds light on Pilatus case ‘cover-up’,"April 15, 2023 10:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A book launched by Repubblika president Robert Aquilina on Saturday elaborates on what he describes as a “coverup” carried out by elements of the Malta Police Force and the Office of the Attorney General when it comes to financial crimes carried out at the nowdefunct Pilatus Bank Aquilina’s book titled ‘Pilatus A Laundromat Bank in Europe’ builds on months of his and Repubblika’s investigations into the case and on the various sources who have provided inside information on how the authorities responded to this claims And for the most part these findings do not put the authorities in a good light as Aquilina highlighted in an appearance on Andrew Azzopardi on 103 that aired right after the launch of his book A clear exception to this rule is the inquiring magistrate Ian Farrugia who Aquilina makes clear did his job properly including by utilising the services of US financial consultancy firm Duff  Phelps – which has since rebranded as Kroll – to analyse the goingson at the bank This ensured that his inquiry came at a considerable cost – €75 million – but its recommendations included prosecuting the bank and 6 of these top officials But only one has been prosecuted so far – money laundering reporting officer ClaudeAnne Sant Fournier against whom proceedings are ongoing And a nolle prosequi – a notice that prosecution is being abandoned – was issued in favour of two persons risk manager Antoniella Gauci and operations supervisor Mehmet Tasli Aquilina took aim at the nolle prosequi notices in his book and in the radio interview revealing that the authorities’ priority was to protect one of their beneficiaries for reasons yet to be confirmed Aquilina citing sources observed that the priority for the police and the AG was to ensure that no action is taken against Gauci The nolle prosequi in favour of Tasli was only a consequence of this since his role in the financial crimes flagged by the inquiry was less significant than Gauci’s own the authorities could thus hardly pursue him and let Gauci go free In any case the ringleaders were the bank’s ownerchairman and its CEO Iranian nationals Ali Sadr Hasheminejad and Hamidreza Ghanbari respectively with Aquilina highlighting that the inquiry highlights how both resorted to bullying their colleagues as they utilised their bank as a “laundromat” for account holders amassing wealth from questionable sources But all four others – Sant Fournier Gauci Tasli and chief operating officer Luis Felipe Rivera – complied with the bank’s “criminal designs” he made clear A question mark remains on why the authorities prioritised freeing Gauci of any legal consequences though as Aquilina explained to Azzopardi the information provided by his sources points at two main hypotheses The first is the Gauci family’s ties to prime minister Robert Abela her father and brother own a Qormi service station which had utilised Abela as their lawyer and were known to be canvassers for the PM But the second suggestion may be the information she holds “Another source suggested that Gauci knows all too well about who owns Egrant” Aquilina said referring to the Panamanian company opened along with those owned by Joseph Muscat’s righthand man Keith Schembri and former minister Konrad Mizzi whose ultimate beneficial owner is yet to be proven Aquilina’s book also reproduces the texts of internal police emails related to the issuing of a nolle prosequi in favour of Gauci and Tasli which he argue show clearly how the police enthusiastically sought to ensure that the two were spared any legal consequences Rather than concluding that a nolle prosequi was appropriate based on the evidence at hand the police appeared to have worked backwards finding ways to justify a decision that had already been made The emails include one by thendeputy commissioner Alexandra Mamo telling the inspectors handling the paperwork that “thank you would be an understatement” as she highlighted the tight deadlines being set by the Office of the Attorney General Mamo ended up tendering her resignation last November with Aquilina stating that the information he has in hand suggests that the fallout from the Pilatus case played a key role He also said that police sources have made clear that police commissioner Angelo Gafà’s strategy in the face of such issues was to “always find a scapegoat” “I have no doubt that Alexandra Mamo has a lot of responsibility to bear” he said “But ultimately the final responsibility lies with Gafà” Repubblika has filed challenge proceedings against both Gafà and Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg over their respective roles in the failure to follow the recommendations of the magisterial inquiry and Buttigieg’s own role is also expounded on in his book And at times this role appears to have taken a farcical bent Aquilina observed that when Magistrate Farrugia submitted the inquiry and all relevant documents to Buttigieg – some 600000 pages in all – the AG proved reluctant to delve into them Instead he said she “insisted that he sign every page” The request drew obvious protests from Farrugia who highlighted that it would literally take months but in the face of Buttigieg’s insistence he actually complied with the onerous request But the farce was yet to be brought to a conclusion because Buttigieg once more sent the documents back to the magistrate “She insisted that he must also sign the back of each page” Aquilina added Ultimately Aquilina’s book raises a lot of questions on the Pilatus case and the wider implications though the Repubblika president readily concedes that he doesn’t have all the answers in hand “Of course I haven’t solved the puzzle but I am contributing information in the hope that we can do so one day” he said And in the process Aquilina takes comfort from the many sources who have begun speaking to him and fellow activists as they strive to reveal the whole truth “I am impressed to find many people working in our institutions who are fed up to the gills” he said “And I am convinced that through my sources and the sources of other journalists and activists this country can achieve justice and rid itself of the criminality that has infested its institutions”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Ruling on spring hunting for turtle doves expected on Monday,"April 14, 2023 6:15 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The opening of a hunting season for turtle doves will be delayed by at least a few hours – if it opens at all – after a judge confirmed that he will rule on BirdLife Malta’s request for an injunction on Monday morning the day in which the season was set to start At present a provisional injunction issued by Judge Giovanni Grixti prevents the government from issuing the legal notice through which it seeks a derogation from the EU’s Birds Directive – wrongly according to the infringement proceedings launched  by the European Commission – to authorise the hunting of the vulnerable European turtle doves during their spring migration In line with the conclusions of the Ornis Committee – where the prohunting positions of government appointees and hunters’ representatives outnumber the dissent of BirdLife Malta’s own – the season was set to open on 17 April and end on 30 April Judge Grixti was set to start hearing submissions on the case on 18 April though the government was successful in speeding up the case with proceedings launching on Friday But Friday’s 90minute sitting which saw the lawyers representing BirdLife and the government make their case ended with Judge Grixti announcing that he would hand down his decree on Monday at 9am BirdLife Malta was represented by lawyers Claire Bonello and Martin Farrugia with the latter emphasising that the NGO had a clear juridical interest in pursuing the case and accusing the government of trivialising the declining numbers of the European turtle dove a species deemed vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN He said that there was a clear consensus on the vulnerability of the species and on the fact that the main threats it faced were hunting and habitat loss The oncecommon species he argued is in a sharp decline with its numbers falling by 80 over the past 30 years The government was represented by lawyers Charlene Muscat and Anthony Borg from the Office of the State Advocate with the former insisting that BirdLife Malta was presenting an effectively identical request for injunction to the unsuccessful one it made last year with the only difference being that this was filed before the publication of the relevant legal notice The argument was rejected by BirdLife’s lawyers who castigated the fact that the state has taken no positive action to preserve the species and that in the past year numbers have continued to decline Borg however insisted that the claim of declining numbers was not corroborated by evidence and that the migrating population was stable Meanwhile BirdLife Malta published a letter dated 12 April by the IUCN addressed to the EU’s Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius urging the Commission to “immediately request that Malta protect the European Turtledove on its prenuptial migration and refrain from opening a spring hunting season in 2023 and in subsequent years until the species has recovered sufficiently to warrant uplisting under IUCN Red List Criteria” The letter by Joe Wood cochair of the IUCN’s SSC Pigeon and Dove Specialist Group PDSG described Malta’s lifting of a moratorium on the spring hunting of the species as an “alarming development” “The PDSG is firm in our view that the deliberate killing of any turtle doves at such a critical stage in their life cycle should be halted with immediate effect so as to not compromise the EU’s collective commitment to ensuring the recovery of this species” Wood wrote
PBS investigating how TVM ended up promoting Hitler hagiography,"April 14, 2023 4:02 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Public Broadcasting Service said that it was considering the presenter and producers of a programme in which the author of a book glorifying and justifying Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime was interviewed uncritically to have carried out a “serious breach of contract” The public broadcaster issued a statement on the TVM News programme in reaction to the controversy that has arisen this week over the 23 March edition of the programme Ħajjitna Ktieb hosted by veteran presenter John Demanuele That programme featured correctional officer Ronald Bugeja who spoke on his book titled “Mein Führer Adolf Hitler – lIstorja u lBijografija” and who was not challenged on his views Though the broadcast initially flew under the radar the book and subsequently the programme came to the attention of activist and blogger Manuel Delia this week leading to numerous individuals and NGOs expressing outrage at how such a broadcast was allowed to happen The programme was still available on the TVMi on demand service until Friday morning when it was quietly removed In a statement which acknowledged receipt of various letters complaining about and criticising the station’s airing of Bugeja’s questionable views PBS said that “it condemned with all its strength” Bugeja’s declarations “PBS is also investigating how these comments were allowed to be broadcast on the public broadcaster” the company said Its registered editor Charles Dalli announced that he had personally launched an investigation into a case in which the editorial rules applying to each TVM production had clearly been broken and on why the episode did not appear to have undergone editorial scrutiny from production or from the quality control department “The producers and the presenter of the programme have been informed that their shortcomings in this production constitute a serious breach of contract and have been asked to provide an explanation of what happened At the same time the people tasked with quality control of the programme are asked to explain how the programme passed their scrutiny” PBS said The broadcaster promised to take “all the necessary and adequate steps” once its internal investigation is concluded “which may include the application of contractual consequences and disciplinary action against all those with responsibility to ensure that such content is not broadcast” TVM has also aired an apology by the programme’s presenter with Demanuele addressing his words “to whoever felt offended” by the content of the programme The presenter said that the aim of the programme was always to give an opportunity to authors to reflect on their own work and not a vehicle through which we would deliver his opinions “To whoever felt offended by the content of the programme I apologise – on my behalf and on the producers’ behalf – and I hope that such episodes do not repeat themselves in the future” he said Newsbookcommt had sent questions to both the PBS and the Culture Ministry with the questions sent to PBS largely addressed by its public statement The ministry led by Owen Bonnici meanwhile emphasised its condemnation of the controversial broadcast “This type of content has no place on any medium” a ministry spokesperson confirmed to the newsroom The ministry said that Bonnici was not aware of the programme prior to its broadcast and that “he definitely does not condone the declarations made by the author of the book” as it highlighted that it was leaving the matter in the hands of the PBS At least one complaint to PBS and the Broadcasting Authority has already been made by academic and independent political candidate Arnold Cassola addressed to Dalli and BA chief executive Joanna Spiteri Spiteri confirmed to Newsbookcommt that any complaints received would be investigated according to the relevant subsidiary legislation to the Broadcasting Act The Code for the Investigation and Determination of Complaints specifies that complaints must first be considered by the broadcaster – PBS in this case – who are required to reply to the complainant within three days The broadcaster is required to take appropriate action if the complaint is upheld in whole or in part Should the complaint not be upheld however then the complainant is entitled to take the matter up with the authority This would launch a longer process which would require both the complainant and the broadcaster to make oral submissions and on which the law specifies no timeframes It thus remains to be seen whether the response to the case will be longdrawn out even if the broadcast itself has been roundly condemned including by the ministry and by Dalli who said that the national broadcaster did not find Bugeja’s remarks acceptable And the ministry told Newsbookcommt emphatically that “this type of content has no place on any medium” Bugeja’s book mentions the National Book Council in its acknowledgments leading the council to issue a statement confirming that it “has in no way provided any financial assistance support or visibility” to the book In response to a question by the newsroom the ministry confirmed that “no entity within the Ministry provided any form of support towards this book” The council said that it only provided the book with the International Standard Book Number as the Maltese ISBN representative last May emphasising that issuing this number was not linked to the content of the publication It said that it was only alerted to the content of the book when it was assessed for eligibility for the National Book Prize leading it to seek legal advice on 28 March Consequently it decided not to include the book in the long list of nominees for the prize in light of the book’s content and the ethical concerns this raised The council also highlighted potential legal implications of the book suggesting that it may fall foul of Article 82B of the Criminal Code which criminalises the condoning denying or trivialising of a genocide
Venice Commission should investigate refusal to hold Sofia inquiry – David Casa,"April 14, 2023 2:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti MEP David Casa is calling for the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission to investigate the Maltese government’s persistent refusal to launch an independent public inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia a public inquiry repeatedly sought by the family of the 20yearold who was killed in a construction site collapse last December Casa has written to the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe the Dutch senator Tiny Kox calling on him to raise the issue at the assembly and to mandate an investigation into the government’s actions “Failing an independent dedicated institution to ensure human rights compliance in Malta it falls on the Parliamentary Assembly to probe member states’ governments for their compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights” Casa said PACE was urged to mandate that the Venice Commission – whose official name is the European Commission for Democracy through Law – investigate the government’s “persistent refusal… to abide by its international obligations to the detriment of its citizens” “The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees enjoyment above all of the right to life When a person’s life is taken or lost the state has positive obligations to conduct an effective investigation into the death of one of its citizens” the MEP explained Casa emphasised that the refusal to launch an independent public inquiry following Sofia’s death did not occur in isolation recalling to the prolonged international campaign that had taken place before the government relented to launch an independent public inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia “Such an effort should not be required every time” he insisted adding that “there are compelling reasons for an independent public inquiry into the death of Jean Paul Sofia” Among them in his view is that “his mother deserves closure” “She deserves to know precisely why her son is no longer with us what led to his demise whether regulations were breached that were meant to keep him safe and whether individuals are responsible and answerable for her son’s loss” the MEP said “The families of lost loved ones in Malta must be protected by the Convention”
Finance minister’s sponsored Facebook post deemed to be ‘minor’ ethics breach,"April 14, 2023 1:46 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Finance Minister Clyde Caruana has accepted that he committed a minor ethics breach through a governmentsponsored Facebook post which was deemed to constitute an ethics breach albeit a relatively minor one given the modest public expenditure involved The sponsored post which was posted on the Finance Ministry’s official Facebook page last October drew a complaint by independent political candidate Arnold Cassola The post which was related to the coming budget prominently featured a photo of Caruana with a quote of his superimposed concerning the subsidising of energy and fuel prices The complaint inevitably remained on the shelf for months given that the post of Standards Commissioner was vacant until it was filled in a controversial manner by former chief justice Joe Azzopardi through an antideadlock mechanism forced through by the government But it now marks the first ethics breach found by Azzopardi even if it is considered to be a minor one given the expense involved – €99 including VAT covering both production and advertising costs Even so Azzopardi made clear that the post gave reason to believe that “the minister is seeking to make political or personal gains to claim credit for the measure in the public’s eyes” “Therefore I have concluded that this case represents the abuse of public funds even if of a very small amount the lack of separation between the role of a minister and an MP and a lack of respect towards the impartiality of the public service” the retired judge said in a letter he sent to Caruana on Wednesday But Azzopardi also highlighted that the minor nature of the case allowed for a quick resolution without the need to refer the matter to Parliament’s Standards Committee He told Caruana that an apology in writing accompanied with a pledge not to repeat the breach of ethics would serve as an adequate remedy Caruana was asked to reply by 28 April but sent his reply on Thursday While he insisted that the Facebook post was an informative one made in good faith he accepted the ruling and made the required apology and pledge The minister also announced that “as a gesture of goodwill and on my own initiative” he was refunding the €99 that had been spent presenting a receipt to this effect The case is thus considered closed and marks the third – and by far most minor in terms of expenditure – situation in which publiclyfunded adverts were deemed to serve partisan or personal interests The first case concerned the expenditure of over €7000 by thenminister Carmelo Abela which was referred to a Standards Committee in which Speaker Anġlu Farrugia controversially abstained from voting In contrast to Caruana Abela has not refunded a single cent deeming the matter closed The second case concerns the expenditure of €16700 on an advertising supplement published by the Labour Party’s weekly newspaper KullĦadd in which 17 present and former ministers and parliamentary secretaries were implicated Azzopardi’s predecessor George Hyzler had found an ethics breach and referred the matter to the Standards Committee last June however the committee is yet to discuss the matter
Hunters report BirdLife to authorities for placing dead turtle dove on Castille steps,"April 14, 2023 12:44 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The FKNK hunters’ federation and the Kaċċaturi San Ubertu have both asked the authorities to investigate after BirdLife presented a dead turtle dove on the steps of the Auberge de Castille as proof that a spring hunting season for the vulnerable species has already begun in Malta The court is set to decide on a request for an injunction by BirdLife on Friday if the request is unsuccessful a spring hunting season for the European turtle dove is set to open on Monday A provisional injunction is presently in place But in the press conference in which it presented the dead bird which had been retrieved from Delimara on Thursday morning BirdLife emphasised that the provisional injunction was being breached through hunters who were clearly pursuing migrating turtle doves and through a conspicuous absence of enforcement In their reaction both the FKNK and the KSU focused their outrage on the NGO’s gesture insisting that it was in breach of laws that prohibited the possession of protected birds “Do the fines for possession of dead pigeons only apply to hunters” KSU asked in an open letter to prime minister Robert Abela in which home affairs minister Byron Camilleri police commissioner Angelo Gafà and the data protection commissioner were copied in The FKNK confirmed that they had brought the matter to the attention of the police stating that the BirdLife Malta officials who presented the turtle dove at Castille “have committed a crime according to the law” The federation challenged BirdLife’s insistence that the figures which were being used to justify a spring hunting season for turtle doves – through a derogation from the Birds Directive which has led the European Commission to open infringement proceedings against Malta – were a fabrication It insisted that BirdLife Malta president Darryl Grima’s claim that the figures were a “complete lie” was an example of “extreme arrogance” It also insisted that BirdLife Malta’s press conference and a statement by the Committee Against Bird Slaughter which drew similar conclusions – that the spring hunting for turtle doves is well underway – were an attempt to create “undue pressure” on the court The KSU meanwhile also took aim at “a certain section of the media with a declared antihunting agenda” and insisted that hunters were facing “harassment by members of Birdlife Malta and foreign citizens who have extreme intentions” in their letter to Abela

TVM gives platform to Nazi apologist and his Hitler-praising book,"April 14, 2023 8:46 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A man who wrote a book singing the praises of Adolf Hitler was invited to promote his work on TVM with the national broadcaster seemingly finding no problem with giving prominence to such views The decision has since caused uproar however after blogger and activist Manuel Delia came across the programme which was broadcast on 23 March and which is still viewable online on TVM’s ondemand service TVMi The author of the book “Mein Führer Adolf Hitler LIstorja u lBijografija” – correctional officer Ronald Bugeja was a guest on the programme Ħajjitna Ktieb presented by veteran presenter John Demanuele Despite the questionable subject matter of his book which speaks of the “glorious achievements” of the Nazi party whilst downplaying their horrific war crimes – not least the Holocaust – Bugeja was not even challenged on his views at the programme Delia had chanced on the programme after coming across the book in a local bookshop confirming its nature as an apologia for Hitler and Nazism The book actually acknowledges the National Book Council in its “special thanks” section leading Delia to question whether taxpayer funds funded Bugeja’s selfpublished venture He did not mince his words insisting that TVM’s editorial board should resign in masse over the embarrassing broadcast and that the National Book Council should follow suit if it turned out that it supported the book In comments to the Times NBC chairman Mark Camilleri denied that the council provided any support monetary or otherwise to Bugeja and his book He maintained that the council only became aware of the book and its contents after being alerted to them when it was submitted for nomination for the National Book Prize Repubblika echoed  Delia’s insistence that TVM’s editorial board should resign – a move that would perhaps be a foregone conclusion in much of Europe – and insisted that minister responsible for public broadcasting Owen Bonnici should remove them personally if they did not do so “This scandal is another link in the chain of shame for Public Broadcasting Services which has become a mediocre amateurish and propagandistic station instead of an educational service providing objective quality and accurate information” it said “It is unacceptable that the public broadcaster is used to promote Hitler Nazism and the twisting of history instead of serving to educate the public” PEN Malta which brings together writers artists and activists also demanded immediate action from the public broadcaster and from Bonnici The NGO said that it “is shocked and disgusted by the public broadcaster which far from carrying out its mission of holding an informed and critical public debate is serving as a pulpit for Nazi ideas that are the exact opposite of the values of democracy freedom of thought and information” It insisted that there should be an immediate investigation into how the programme came to be broadcast and that the authorities explain what steps will be taken to prevent a repeat of the incident The academic and independent political candidate Arnold Cassola filed a complaint with the Broadcasting Authority criticising a programme that served as “an apologia of the theories of racial hatred that characterised Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime” “Whoever within TVM andor PBS approved the decision to give space to the exaltation of Adolf Hitler with his theories of hatred that defy the basic tenets of human respect must assume responsibility for their obscene decision” he said Lawyer and former MP Jason Azzopardi meanwhile contacted the Israeli government and the Embassy of Israel in Rome which also has jurisdiction over Malta to alert them that the national broadcaster and the government “are promoting Nazi literature” “Not in my name” he said capitalising the words for effect The author Mark Camilleri – who was replaced by his namesake as NBC chair after becoming an increasingly vocal critic of the government – emphasised in his reaction that even Bugeja’s status as a correctional officer was untenable in light of the book he had written given the cases of racist violence carried out by uniformed officers in recent years These include the murder of Lassana Cisse by two soldiers as well as police officers who were charged with abducting and assaulting foreign nationals at a time when the authorities were carrying out a number of raids focusing on migrants who may lack valid permits Presenter and activist Peppi Azzopardi – a vocal advocate for prison reform – also focused on Bugeja’s day job recounting that the author of the Hitler hagiography “was given a promotion when the prison was being run in a fascist manner”
Floriana hopes St Publius’ triumphal arch will return next year,"April 14, 2023 8:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Floriana will have reason to celebrate next year if plans to rebuild a beloved lost landmark – a historic triumphal arch dedicated to its patron saint St Publius that was lost to an arson attack in 2019 – proceed as planned The project is well under way with the help of donations that have poured in so far but rising costs of raw material have significantly increased its projected cost by around €40000 With this in mind parish priest Fr Charles Cini has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the remaining funds a campaign which will remain open until 23 April – the day in which Floriana celebrates the Feast of St Publius this year The original wooden arch had been inaugurated in 1899 and designed by Giorgio Cassar It was erected on a yearly basis on the Feast of St Publius until World War II when its 79 components were stored in the church crypt The war was devastating to Floriana which suffered widespread destruction as a result of repeated bombing sorties Rebuilding a devastated town was the key priority of the postwar years and the arch’s components remained in the crypt for years seemingly forgotten But in 1997 a team of enthusiasts decided to restore the unique structure a project which was completed in time for its 100th anniversary – the Feast of St Publius in 1999 The arch was once more erected each year as Floriana celebrated its patron saint but the community was shocked to see it targeted by an arson attack on 27 April 2019 an attack which reduced the historic structure to ashes Floriana mourned the loss of its beloved arch but the community was largely united in its intention to rebuild the structure a plan which quickly received the blessing of Archbishop Charles Scicluna who offered a donation on behalf of the Church Additional donations and funding from government entities had helped the parish reach its initial fundraising goal and the arch is now twothirds complete The rebuilding is faithful to Cassar’s original design reversing minor modifications that had been carried out when it was restored in the 1990s But the project has been impacted by the Covid19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which has seen the cost of raw material skyrocket Among other rising costs a sheet of wood which would have cost just €28 a few years ago now carries an €84 price tag Despite this setback however the enthusiasts overseeing the restoration are hopeful that the arch will once more take pride of place in Floriana in what would have been the 125th anniversary of the original arch next year’s feast
Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “criminal association to launder money originating from corruption” Aquilina described it as a “textbook case of money laundering” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country” “From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “remained silent and has not denied anything”
PM flouts parliament rules to react to hospitals report before anyone can read it,"May 15, 2023 6:46 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela was so keen to respond to the National Audit Office’s damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it properly that he chose to openly flout parliamentary procedure to do so Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on a report that appears to be an embarrassment to his government saw him bring it up in Parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon the government rejected its suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In the absence of an agreement Parliament continued with its scheduled debate on the financial estimates of the Environment and Resources Authority while the Nationalist Party scheduled an urgent press conference for 530pm at Parliament House But just as the PN’s press conference was about to begin – in timing that could hardly be considered coincidental – Abela chose to participate in the ERA debate to react to the report In doing so he was clearly out of order and in breach of parliamentary procedure as repeatedly highlighted by PN leader Bernard Grech and other MPs in points of order that they raised But while speaker Anġlu Farrugia accepted that Abela was in breach of procedure Malta’s longestserving speaker proved unable or unwilling to intervene His repeated appeals to Abela fell on deaf ears and Farrugia opted against taking further action While no journalist had been given the opportunity to read the 450page report properly before Abela launched his speech – the report was only made public around an hour earlier – the initial reports by Maltese newsrooms seized on the AuditorGeneral’s conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over a deal with Steward Health Care which obliged the government to pay the company €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled But Abela – who was legal adviser to his predecessor Joseph Muscat when this controversial agreement was reached – made no reference to this or any reference to Mizzi or Muscat at all Instead he focused on a limited defence on what took place when he became PM in 2020 and insisted that he was actually pleased with the findings of the report because for all the problems identified with the concession the report did not identify any misconduct on the part of his own government Consequently he argued he and his government were “serene” even if his insistence on reacting to a report before anyone could actually read it suggested an entirely different scenario Abela also referred to Grech’s decision last week to call on police commissioner Angelo Gafà to investigate him in connection with the hospitals deal insisting that the NAO report made clear that this gambit made no sense as it lacked any credibility As he did so he also drew comparison with a previous criminal complaint targeting his government that made by Repubblika in the wake of the death of a group of asylum seekers in Malta’s searchandrescue area and reports alleging the intentional sabotage of a rubber boat As he had then Abela complained that the PN – he had made no distinction between the party and the activist group three years ago and did not do so on Monday – wanted to send him to prison But in doing so the selfdescribed progressive political leader also reiterated antimigrant rhetoric that would generally be considered to be the preserve of farright politicians describing Malta’s actions in 2020 as a reaction to “increased infections” caused by asylum seekers There is no suggestion that asylum seekers – which are in any case detained at length on arrival through Malta’s controversial detention policy described as “arbitrary” by the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner  – had contributed to the spread of Covid19 or other infections at the time In fact Abela’s government at the time had even taken the unorthodox – and highly questionable from a human rights perspective – step of housing asylum seekers for weeks on end on pleasure boats that were patently unfit for this purpose Abela’s speech predictably derailed the discussion with the next PN MPs to speak taking his cue to disregard the agenda of the day to react to his comments Grech and former PN leader Adrian Delia both described Abela’s actions as an attempt to control the narrative on a scandal before anyone could reasonably read the report The PN leader dismissed the impression Abela sought to portray describing the NAO report as “yet another confirmation that the Labour governments of Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela are accomplices to the greatest fraud this country has ever witnessed” He insisted that Abela’s decision to speak at the same time the PN’s press conference was taken place was a new “abyss” for Abela which testified to the fact that he is “confused weak and compromised” words he has used to describe Abela in recent weeks Grech was also adamant that the air of serenity Abela was seeking to project was a façade and that the PM was clearly preoccupied by the latest developments “He promised continuity” Grech said in reference to remarks Abela nade when he

‘The end result of living in a mafia state is death’ – Pia Zammit,"May 16, 2023 7:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “If you refuse to listen to the voices of the living then you will be forced to hear the screams of even more dead” activist Pia Zammit said in a speech at the 67th monthly vigil commemorating Daphne Caruana Galizia Echoing the phrase from antiMafia activists in Italy and elsewhere Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked harassed and vilified before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much” she said “If you truly want justice for her stories then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice To protect them from threats and physical harm What are you waiting for More deaths” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection In her speech Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country and a mafia state” adding that people fall in three camps those who endorse corruption those who turn a blind eye to corruption and those who actually see the full picture “However we’re all experiencing the full picture whether we like it or not” she said as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue  The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law” Zammit said “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women” Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime” He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree” Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice that they are not alone “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat ‘We will get there’ Sa Naslu is true It will happen if we don’t give up It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other” Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly or tells me that I will at least be here to see it the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner”
PN to hold national protest on Wednesday,"May 16, 2023 6:55 PM",The Nationalist Party will be holding national protest outside parliament on Wednesday following the damning NAO report on the hospitals privatisation deal Speaking in parliament on Tuesday evening PN leader Bernard Grech said the protest is being called as prime minister Robert Abela continues to undermine the country’s institutions The Opposition has held a series of protests after court annulled the deal which it said was fraudulent in February The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In recent days the PN has asked police chief Angelo Gafa to launch a criminal investigation on the individuals involved in the deal including Mizzi and Muscat however the police force has so far failed to react Moreover on Monday Abela chose to respond to the damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it by breaching parliamentary rules Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on the embarrassing report saw him bring it up in parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon with government rejecting a suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday Moreover on Tuesday the Labour Party held a press conference in which minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul insisted that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet

Gaddafi’s relative received $1.4m into Maltese bank account – OCCRP,"April 12, 2023 5:14 PM",A relative of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi moved millions of dollars intended to buy a ferry for Sierra Leone into his personal Maltese bank account according to an investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project OCCRP The global network of investigate journalists also found that Abdusalam Abulghasem Abughila who is one of Gaddafi’s brotherinlaws also used a Maltabased company he owned to lease the ferry to the company that operated it leaving Abughila with well over 1 million in profits According to the report between 2008 and 2009 a Libyan state investment fund allocated 4 million to buy a new ferry for wartorn Sierra Leone but Abughila appears to have siphoned off 14 million into his personal bank account with Maltabased FIMBank and used the rest to buy an old ferry in poor condition The dilapidated ferry was eventually sent to a junkyard as it had left passengers stranded in the middle of the sea several times In its report the OCCRP said that a joint venture between Abughila and the Libyan government was supposed to purchase the ferry while the government would own it Instead Abughila allegedly had the money sent to his personal bank account and bought the boat through his Panamanian offshore company instead A ferry had already been bought by Libya for Sierra Leone in 2004 however Gaddafi wanted to buy a second ferry because at the time he was keen on investing oil money across the African continent wanting to expand his influence across the region The ferry was operated by Afrimpex Navigation Co Ltd a subsidiary of a company registered in Malta controlled by Abughila Abughila recommended adding a second ferry to the route and LAIP agreed to invest 4 million into the project with the vessel to be controlled by a new version of Afrimpex based in Belgium In the original agreement it was stipulated that Afrimpex would purchase the ferry and operate it while paying 60 of profits to the LAIP annually while the LAIP would also retain ownership of the ferry However according to the OCCRP the 14 million of the 4 million provided by LAIP for the ferry was subsequently deposited into Abughila’s personal bank rather than a company bank account belonging to Afrimpex Despite receiving 4 million to purchase the ferry bank statements show that the vessel procured actually cost 26 million It was paid for in two instalments with one payment sent from Abhughila’s personal account and the second from the offshore company Abhughila drew up an agreement in which Maltabased company Afrimpex Navigation Co Ltd would lease the ferry from Almuhit for 120000 a year between 2010 and 2014 This meant that Abhughila not only made off with 14 million in siphoned funds from the original ferry investment the OCCRP said but secretly arranged for his own company to make money off of its operation by retaining its ownership and leasing it back to Afrimpex
FreeHour controversy: Lawyer had warned law might lead to security analysts’ prosecution,"April 12, 2023 4:12 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Lawyers had been warning for months that security analysts face dangers of criminal prosecution under the current legal framework in Malta despite the fact that vulnerability scanning is an essential part of any effective cybersecurity program Technology lawyer Dr Karl Sammut had already sounded the alarm back in February two months before it was revealed that four computer science students are being investigated by the Police after finding and highlighting a security weakness in Malta’s largest student application FreeHour According to a report by the Times of Malta after emailing their findings to FreeHour’s owner and asking for a reward – or ‘bug bounty’ as it is known in the industry – for spotting the mistake in the company’s computer systems the four were met with a Police arrest and the seizure of their computer equipment Speaking to Newsbookcommt Dr Sammut noted that while bounty programs are becoming popular among companies in Malta as a way of incentivising security researchers and hackers to report vulnerabilities in their systems they are still not widely adopted He added that many security researchers conduct vulnerability assessments and other security testing on their own initiative without them being engaged by a client and outside the perimeter of a bounty program However in Malta as in many other countries this can be considered illegal and may lead to criminal charges Meanwhile students have taken to social media to express anger at the fact that their data was put at risk by the company The vulnerability that the four students uncovered could have meant the potential leak of the private data of the users of the app which allows students to share their college timetable with friends FreeHour CEO Zach Ciappara has in the meantime responded to the backlash saying that his company was legally obliged to file a police report against the students “In October we received an email from these four students explaining there was a vulnerability in FreeHour’s backend and that they had gained access to parts of the system” Ciappara explained This email gave FreeHour a threemonth deadline to secure a vulnerability and requested a bug bounty as a reward for identifying the flaw “We were quite concerned and shocked We spoke to our developers to get them to immediately start working on fixing this issue and investigate it” Ciappara said “Luckily no data was compromised and the flaw in the system was fixed in a few hours Within 24 hours a patch was released which made everyone’s data secure” Ciappara said that he consulted lawyers and the Information and Data Commissioner who he said had informed him that FreeHour was legally bound under GDPR law to report the hack to the police “Our intent was to cover ourselves legally If we hadn’t filed a report we would have been breaking the law ourselves Our intent was never to get these students in trouble or to go after them directly” Despite FreeHour’s CEO saying that his company was legally obliged to file the report many are pointing out that the system flaw meant the students had admin access and thus technically did not hack into the system

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Gaddafi’s relative received $1.4m into Maltese bank account – OCCRP,"April 12, 2023 5:14 PM",A relative of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi moved millions of dollars intended to buy a ferry for Sierra Leone into his personal Maltese bank account according to an investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project OCCRP The global network of investigate journalists also found that Abdusalam Abulghasem Abughila who is one of Gaddafi’s brotherinlaws also used a Maltabased company he owned to lease the ferry to the company that operated it leaving Abughila with well over 1 million in profits According to the report between 2008 and 2009 a Libyan state investment fund allocated 4 million to buy a new ferry for wartorn Sierra Leone but Abughila appears to have siphoned off 14 million into his personal bank account with Maltabased FIMBank and used the rest to buy an old ferry in poor condition The dilapidated ferry was eventually sent to a junkyard as it had left passengers stranded in the middle of the sea several times In its report the OCCRP said that a joint venture between Abughila and the Libyan government was supposed to purchase the ferry while the government would own it Instead Abughila allegedly had the money sent to his personal bank account and bought the boat through his Panamanian offshore company instead A ferry had already been bought by Libya for Sierra Leone in 2004 however Gaddafi wanted to buy a second ferry because at the time he was keen on investing oil money across the African continent wanting to expand his influence across the region The ferry was operated by Afrimpex Navigation Co Ltd a subsidiary of a company registered in Malta controlled by Abughila Abughila recommended adding a second ferry to the route and LAIP agreed to invest 4 million into the project with the vessel to be controlled by a new version of Afrimpex based in Belgium In the original agreement it was stipulated that Afrimpex would purchase the ferry and operate it while paying 60 of profits to the LAIP annually while the LAIP would also retain ownership of the ferry However according to the OCCRP the 14 million of the 4 million provided by LAIP for the ferry was subsequently deposited into Abughila’s personal bank rather than a company bank account belonging to Afrimpex Despite receiving 4 million to purchase the ferry bank statements show that the vessel procured actually cost 26 million It was paid for in two instalments with one payment sent from Abhughila’s personal account and the second from the offshore company Abhughila drew up an agreement in which Maltabased company Afrimpex Navigation Co Ltd would lease the ferry from Almuhit for 120000 a year between 2010 and 2014 This meant that Abhughila not only made off with 14 million in siphoned funds from the original ferry investment the OCCRP said but secretly arranged for his own company to make money off of its operation by retaining its ownership and leasing it back to Afrimpex
FreeHour controversy: Lawyer had warned law might lead to security analysts’ prosecution,"April 12, 2023 4:12 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Lawyers had been warning for months that security analysts face dangers of criminal prosecution under the current legal framework in Malta despite the fact that vulnerability scanning is an essential part of any effective cybersecurity program Technology lawyer Dr Karl Sammut had already sounded the alarm back in February two months before it was revealed that four computer science students are being investigated by the Police after finding and highlighting a security weakness in Malta’s largest student application FreeHour According to a report by the Times of Malta after emailing their findings to FreeHour’s owner and asking for a reward – or ‘bug bounty’ as it is known in the industry – for spotting the mistake in the company’s computer systems the four were met with a Police arrest and the seizure of their computer equipment Speaking to Newsbookcommt Dr Sammut noted that while bounty programs are becoming popular among companies in Malta as a way of incentivising security researchers and hackers to report vulnerabilities in their systems they are still not widely adopted He added that many security researchers conduct vulnerability assessments and other security testing on their own initiative without them being engaged by a client and outside the perimeter of a bounty program However in Malta as in many other countries this can be considered illegal and may lead to criminal charges Meanwhile students have taken to social media to express anger at the fact that their data was put at risk by the company The vulnerability that the four students uncovered could have meant the potential leak of the private data of the users of the app which allows students to share their college timetable with friends FreeHour CEO Zach Ciappara has in the meantime responded to the backlash saying that his company was legally obliged to file a police report against the students “In October we received an email from these four students explaining there was a vulnerability in FreeHour’s backend and that they had gained access to parts of the system” Ciappara explained This email gave FreeHour a threemonth deadline to secure a vulnerability and requested a bug bounty as a reward for identifying the flaw “We were quite concerned and shocked We spoke to our developers to get them to immediately start working on fixing this issue and investigate it” Ciappara said “Luckily no data was compromised and the flaw in the system was fixed in a few hours Within 24 hours a patch was released which made everyone’s data secure” Ciappara said that he consulted lawyers and the Information and Data Commissioner who he said had informed him that FreeHour was legally bound under GDPR law to report the hack to the police “Our intent was to cover ourselves legally If we hadn’t filed a report we would have been breaking the law ourselves Our intent was never to get these students in trouble or to go after them directly” Despite FreeHour’s CEO saying that his company was legally obliged to file the report many are pointing out that the system flaw meant the students had admin access and thus technically did not hack into the system

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul

Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “criminal association to launder money originating from corruption” Aquilina described it as a “textbook case of money laundering” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country” “From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “remained silent and has not denied anything”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"“Stop holding useless meetings,” MUMN tells government","April 12, 2023 1:25 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses has stated that it is willing to suspend its directives when the government finally stops holding “useless” meetings and declares its proposals as final The union was reacting was reacting to a statement by the Ministry of Health which said that it had decided to refer an ongoing industrial dispute to conciliation after deeming the MUMN’s industrial actions as “unjustified” and “unreasonable” The dispute concerns a sectoral agreement signed between the nursing union and government in 2018 which lapsed in December Negotiations are ongoing to sign a new deal but government and the nurses’ union have not yet come to an agreement over the conditions particularly the nurses’ and midwives’ salaries As a result the MUMN has been issuing several directives to its members with the most recent set directed at nurses at health centres and at the Gozo General Hospital Other healthcare professionals have raised their concern about these directives in view of the risks that patients might face from delayed surgeries In Wednesday’s statement the MUMN stated that when the government declares its proposals as final it will suspend the directives and summon its 4000 members to an extraordinary general conference to vote on the proposals The MUMN added that if the proposals given to it are not the final ones and Health Minister Chris Fearne is prepared to offer better proposals then these proposals are to be sent to the union immediately The union told off the government for beating around the bush and for rendering this process to the ridicule of a conciliatory meeting “This would be another “useless” meeting with the only purpose is to stop the nurses  midwives to fight for their rights as to have better working conditions” the union said referring to the conciliatory meeting The Union expressed its shock at the proposals presented by government and at the fact that the Government proposed that the nurses and midwives work an additional 16 hours per week on top of their 40hour week to benefit from a certain allowance “This is unreachable for most nurses and midwives as they many are still raising their children 74 of the nursing  midwifery professions are made up from the female gender” the union noted The MUMN went on to list a number of problems that it found with the government’s counter proposals For instance the union found problem with the fact that the proposals still place nurses and midwives as the lowest paid amongst the health professionals in the country They also continue to discriminate against the nursing and midwifery professions who are forced to work a 466hour week rather than a 40hour week as done by the whole civil service Furthermore the proposals are still penalising nurses and midwives if they get sick by deducting their allowances when sick leave is availed They also continue to deprive nurses and midwives of managerial salary scales when compared to other health professionals Nurses and midwives are also still being deprived of their Covid Allowance and other allowances that were promised to the nurses and midwives during the COVID pandemic Not only that but the government is still failing to address the shortage of 500 nurses which the health service needs to sustain its services to the patients
Malta to get first carbon neutral building in Santa Venera,"April 12, 2023 12:29 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A commercial office block in Santa Venera has been developed using sustainable material targeting carbon neutral making it the first of its kind in Malta Like other European countries Malta is under pressure to reach climate change targets and the maligned construction industry plays a pivotal role in reaching such targets While very few developers are doing their part to help the country’s reach such targets a few have set their sights on targeting carbon zero buildings One of these is Gerada Quality Construction which has been appointed as the sole representative of Climablock in Malta Climablock is a highquality ICF Insulated Concrete Form system which combines the structural integrity of concrete and the thermal insulation properties of EPS Expanded Polystyrene The system is based on forms – the Climablock elements – that can be easily and rapidly interconnected to form a structure suitable for pouring concrete After the concrete hardens the system provides thermal insulation during winter and summer ensuring high energy savings Owners of carbon neutral buildings enjoy the comfort of living in much more comfortable spaces and lower utility bills  Such ways of building also reduce noise thanks to the robust double insulated walls The simple and quick installation and the anitseismic benefits compliment such buildings Solely replacing traditional globigerina limestone ġebla talfranka and or hollow concrete blocks with these Insulated Concrete blocks reduces the development’s carbon footprint and construction waste as these already use recycled materials In addition since these blocks lock into each other it reduces the need to cut the blocks However should it be required this is easily done using a hot knife with no atmospheric pollution such as dust Likewise the unusable cut offs of the ICF are easily packed into lightweight sacks and transported to a recycling facility On the other hand traditional materials would are cut using a rotary saw causing fine dust particulate to pollute the air Additionally the unusable cut offs which would be more bulky and heavier to transport would likely end up as land fill since it would need more energy to recycle Gerada Quality Construction was awarded the Leader in Sustainable initiative at the Malta Business Awards which took place late last year Video Gerada Quality Construction

“I could hear the music playing outside from the altar” – Fr Ramon Farrugia,"April 12, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Franciscan friar Ramon Farrugia from the Church of ta’ Ġieżu in Valletta spoke to Newsbookcommt about last week’s Holy Week activities which were disrupted by commercial activities saying that the issue needs to be addressed immediately Fr Ramon explained that the issue goes beyond the Holy Week activities as churchgoers are forced to listen to loud music playing in the background from nearby bars every evening while they attempt to hear mass Sometimes even the celebrant himself can hear the music while celebrating mass on the altar “At times we had to close the door Other times churchgoers go outside and ask the owners to tone the music down obviously getting ignored and ridiculed” the religious priest said “To celebrate mass in peace we always have to inform either the Police or the mayor to intervene Some cooperate but others listen to nobody” Fr Ramon noted that people living in Valletta who still go to Church are fed up with the situation He said that he has often spoken with the authorities asking for policies to be enacted addressing the situation and for a reasonable balance to be reached between commercial enterprises and places of worship “The spiritual dimension is important in the person’s life and every place of worship whichever the religion may be should be protected” he insisted Newsbookcommt reported on the chaotic situation in Valletta during last week’s Holy Week when the Good Friday procession was forced to wade through a sea of tables and chairs while the pilgrimage to mark Our Lady of Sorrows ended up being held against a cacophony of loud music being played through outside speakers and people shouting Members of the Valletta local council have agreed that an urgent meeting should be convened to discuss the situation Fr Ramon also mentioned how an important characteristic of the convent is the aspect of silence noting that “now even this has been lost from the convent of the Franciscan Friars” The convent located between St Paul’s street and St Ursola’s street is over 400 years old Presently seven priests live in it while a large number of pilgrims both Maltese and foreign visit the convent and the Church of ta’ Ġieżu throughout the year Newsbookcommt is informed that the situation in Valletta is also the main reason why the procession with the Blessed Sacrament which used to leave St John’s CoCathedral on the feast of Corpus Christi started taking place in Mdina instead of the capital city The procession that used to take place on the feast of the birth of St John the Baptist has also stopped taking place for the same reason The uncontrolled commercialisation of Valletta is evidently hindering and sometimes killing religious customs This situation has spurred a movement of enthusiasts who are now preparing to form a provisional committee “with the aim of promoting and saving the tradition of the Passion of Christ in our country” This initiative was started by the secretary general of the San Filep Band Club of Żebbuġ Brian Bonnici who said on social media that such a committee ensures that “things are done seriously” Bonnici who is well known in the artistic sector in Malta said that “the collective interest should prevail over individual interest or the interests of a group or a village”

Muscat received payments from Swiss firm that was previously called VGH Europe,"May 17, 2023 10:12 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat received two payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group This has emerged from the corruption probe into Muscat as part of an investigation into potential corruption related to the Vitals Global Healthcare VGH deal The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe linked to the hospitals’ deal according to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Investigators are probing whether a potentially bogus consultancy contract was drawn up to justify the €60000 in consultancy payments Muscat received from SpringX Media and Accutor Consulting which used to be called VGH Europe Although Muscat denies any link between the payments and Vitals the company’s name was changed to Accutor Consulting AG in January 2018 just before Steward Healthcare took over the hospitals’ concession from VGH Muscat was paid a total of €60000 to his Bank of Valletta account in 2020 the first payment taking place just two months after he stepped down in January of that year The former prime minister received four monthly payments two from Accutor AG and two from Spring X Media another Swiss firm run by the same owner – Pakistani businessman Wasay Bhatti Spring X Media is registered at the same Swiss address as Accutor AG and the two companies carried out transactions between each other The Accutor AG payments to Muscat were made under the terms of an indefinite consultancy contract drawn up between himself and Spring X Media in February 2020 just one month after he resigned Despite the indefinite nature of the consultancy contract signed when Muscat was still an MP the payments ended abruptly in the summer of 2020 The contract was to earn Muscat €15000 a month for three years for a total of €540000 It was also to be automatically renewed for another three years before it was suddenly stopped after four monthly payments when Accutor went out of business Muscat’s residence was searched by police in January 2022 as a result of an inquiry anticorruption NGO Repubblika requested in 2018 But Muscat denied that the search had anything to do with his Accutor contract or suspicions that it was bogus and merely a vehicle to receive kickbacks from the hospitals’ deal Likewise the reports say that former minister Konrad Mizzi’s home has also been searched as part of the probe and had his smartphone confiscated by police Transactions of Accutor AG the Swiss payroll company that played a key role in funnelling funds from VGHSteward and Bluestone show that the companies sent at least €7 million to Accutor which then directed payments toward VGH directors and behindthescenes investors According to his 2020 tax return Muscat declared an income of almost €482000 from various consultancy work in the year he resigned as prime minister The earnings were covered by a flurry of consultancy contracts Muscat signed in the weeks and months after resigning Following an unprecedented political and institutional crisis Muscat announced his resignation in December 2019 but actually resigned in January 2020 Muscat baulked under the pressure of weeks of protests following the the emergence of alleged links between government officials and the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and the arrest of Yorgen Fenech Fenech is awaiting a trial after being accused of masterminding the murder Moreover his Dubairegistered company 17 Black allegedly intended to funnel money to two Panama companies belonging to then energy minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s right hand man Keith Schembri According to The Times prime minister Robert Abela is wary of the inquiry’s outcome as he is concerned that highprofile arrests and possible prosecutions could throw the Labour Party into disarray Sources said police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police Moreover the investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella According to the reports Muscat claimed that he had been introduced to Bhatti “years back” by his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and that Bhatti got in touch with him “after I announced my resignation” “Strongly refuting” the allegations about the contract Muscat insisted that he has “carried out legitimate and documented work in connection with my contract” However when asked to provide any such documented evidence Muscat refused saying “It is evidence that shows the projects I have been working on and meetings held “I do not believe I should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “everything was carried out accordingly”
Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over hospitals concession deal – NAO,"May 15, 2023 5:41 PM",Former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval a damning NAO audit shows The new audit report states that Mizzi acted in “haste” and the transfer was authorised “unilaterally” without “the appropriate sanction” by the Cabinet of ministers The requests by VGH were only discussed in Cabinet on 9 January 2018 “days after the approvals” by the then tourism minister had already been granted the report says After racking up €36 million in debts VGH then agreed to transfer the contract to Steward Healthcare for a reported €1 The report also belies disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s claims that all decisions taken on the hospitals deal were taken by his Cabinet of ministers Speaking in the aftermath of the court judgment that annulled the concession agreement in February Muscat had claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and collective decisions by the Cabinet Mizzi is also accused of having misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” “The delegation of responsibility for a health concession to the Minister for Tourism was deemed illogical by the NAO and provided a convenient opportunity for the exploitation of Government creating weakness where there ought to have been none a weakness all to readily leveraged by the SHC” “The most evident exploitation was that secured by the SHC in terms of Government’s liability to pay €100000000 and the sum of the lenders’ debt to the Concessionaire in case of courtdeclared nullity of the concession agreements irrespective of the party attributed the default a situation precipitated by the Minister for Tourism and engineered through his misleading of Cabinet Compounding matters was that Cabinet’s authorisation was not sought by the Minister for Tourism in instances when Government acted as guarantor in several financing agreements entered into by the SHC and the BOV” In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months This came after former PN leader Adrian Delia opened a court case in 2018 in a bid to force the cancellation of the 99year emphyteutical concession agreement on the basis that the original concessionaire VGH and their heirs in title Steward Healthcare had not fulfilled their contractual obligations Depasquale had harsh words for all parties involved in the deal including government concessionaires VGH and Steward Healthcare and in a scathing sentence said government had failed to protect the national interest in the privatisation deal In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement” Defying all logic the judge said Mizzi granted VGH another three years automatically extendable for another year and a half that is four and a half years in total ie until the end of the year 2022 to do what they had failed to do by September 2018 The judge also pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back The latest report was tabled in parliament on Monday afternoon Government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament holds an urgent debate on the report published by the NAO But the Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO’s findings Moreover the National Audit Office expressed great concern that Mizzi refused to collaborate during the probe “It is with the gravest concern that the NAO views the failure of the Minister for Tourism to cooperate in this audit as inexcusable compounded no less by the centrality of his role in the concession The shirking of accountability on the part of the Minister for Tourism hampered this Office in its understanding of the initial developments that led to the concession being taken over by the SHC and impacted other aspects for which he assumed responsibility in relation thereto most notably in authorising the change of control and in representing Government as guarantor for funds secured by the SHC” In addition the NAO said it could not verify assertions made by others regarding the role played by Mizzi in this concession “The NAO holds a bleak view of the Minister for Tourism’s conduct in this respect for ministers of Government and public officials who have acted in the interests of the Government should find no difficulty in accounting for their decisions and actions The action on the part of the Minister for Tourism in not cooperating with the NAO was deemed deplorable”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"Demand for property rentals shoots up, less interest in property sales","April 11, 2023 6:16 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Malta has seen a shift in demand for property sales to rentals as the demand for property rentals increased drastically during the first few months of the year This was revealed in a report by PwC which analysed the current local sentiment towards local real estate demand preferences among 405 respondents between October 2022 and March 2023 According to the survey results demand for property rentals increased from 12 in the first quarter of 2022 to 31 in the first quarter of 2023 On the other hand demand for property sales fell from 51 in the first quarter of 2022 to 42 in the first quarter of 2023 These results registered the highest demand for property rentals and the lowest for property purchases from all the property barometers carried out by PwC to date In its report PwC noted that the results seem to echo secondary market data PwC went on to quote data published by the NSO which indicated that during 2022 the number of promise of sale agreements relating to individual buyers of residential property amounted to 11083 – a 22 decrease when compared to those registered in the previous year On the other hand the Housing Authority’s latest Annual Malta Residential Rental Study showed that by the end of 2021 the rental register comprised almost 38000 active contracts which represented an increase over the prior year The respondents of the survey were also asked which localities they preferred while searching for property The top five most sought after localities according to PwC’s survey were Mosta AttardNaxxar San Ġwann and Birkirkara However NSO data shows that contracts are being registered mostly in Saint Paul’s Bay Birkirkara Żabbar Mosta and Msida PwC noted that people may wish to purchase property in a certain locality but due to high prices end up having to settle for a cheaper location The report also showed a movement between different brackets of property values as respondents shifted towards the lower end of the price spectrum namely from properties valued above €501000 to those valued between €351000 and €500000 This could very likely be influenced by inflationary pressures which dented consumer purchasing power throughout the previous year PwC said

Air Malta blames Easter weekend flight delays on leased aircraft,"April 11, 2023 4:26 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The significant delays that have plagued Air Malta this Easter were caused by a leased aircraft that experienced an issue on the morning of Easter Sunday the airline has said In a statement on the Easter weekend delays Air Malta denied that it was dealing with shortages of pilots or cabin crew emphasising that it had the “correct flight deck and cabin crew complement to operate its entire summer 2023 program” But the national airline appeared to suggest that further delays may well be caused by the withdrawal of an aircraft from the fleet for any period of time highlighting that it was planning to run a “very intense” summer schedule based on the availability of 8 aircraft units At present one of the airline’s aircraft is in heavy maintenance it is expected to return to the fleet in midMay The airline also planned to take delivery of two A320neo aircraft in early 2023 and said that the transition period required it to wetlease two alternative aircraft to cover its schedules The technical issues that disrupted its Easter flights originated in one of these leased planes it said “Due to it being the peak Easter weekend it was not possible to source a replacement aircraft from elsewhere at such short timescales” the airline said “This shortage of one aircraft in the flying program unfortunately resulted in significant delays to the Zurich service on Sunday 9 April and also the Rome and Brussels services on Monday 10 April as well as the London Gatwick service on Tuesday 11 April” This summer the airline plans to operate 155 weekly return flights to 23 destinations relying on the availability of 8 aircraft units “The withdrawal of an aircraft from the fleet for any period of time will have a knockon effect on the rest of the flying program” it said The airline also apologised for the inconveniences caused to its customers and said that it was “working hard to rectify the situation” The delays left many passengers fuming with many taking to social media to air their grievances

Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"Third-country nationals in bureaucratic limbo plead for food, work","April 11, 2023 8:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Malta’s population and economy have grown exponentially over the past decade or so however this has come at a price usually paid by thirdcountry nationals brought over to Malta by recruitment agencies Workers from nonEU countries have become a commodity and a number of recruitment agencies are often accused of exploiting prospective workers Among others workers who pay thousands of euros to agencies are made to wait for months for their work permit and left in a bureaucratic limbo in which they cannot legally work and make a living The work permit can take up to six months to be issued and workers brought to Malta buy agencies are left to their own devices to buy food and pay their rent expenses which can run into thousands especially with rising inflation and property prices in Malta Taking to Facebook one worker in such a situation wrote “I am a thirdcountry national and new on the island I am employed under an agency My papers are still on process and it’s been two months of waiting” Admitting that she is “stuck” the woman said she is “broke” since she cannot legally work until her work permit is issued Pleading for help the woman added “the last money I have goes to my landlord for my rent Do you know where I can ask for some food please in return I can work for it” Such stories are not a rare thing with many replying to the woman saying that they had been in the same situation themselves Moreover Newsbookcommt is informed that many workers in similar situations are facing poverty and turning to food banks NGOs and social media to plead for food and other basic needs Last month Newsbook revealed that a recruitment agency that focuses on recruiting people from South Asia seeking to work in Malta and the EU is facing numerous allegations from prospective workers of false promises of jobs and of various other breaches of the law The company which is led by a Maltaborn man of Pakistani origins boasts of 500 happy customers 128 licenced officers and 2000 assets protected on its website No company bearing its trading name could be found on the Malta Business Registry though that does not preclude its registration in Malta by any other name Serious allegations against it were raised by a Nepali woman who has lived and worked in Malta since 2019 who sought to finance her relatives’ dreams of following her to Malta The woman highlighted that she paid no less than €4200 for her sisters brother and cousins’ applications some 6 months ago to no avail She spoke of how the company was pocketing €700€1000 from each applicant to apply for a single work permit through Identity Malta the agency itself levies a €28050 nonrefundable fee for the application But while obtaining this permit requires a work contract the company was alleged to be offering these permits without securing applicants a job beforehand The company she maintained could be pocketing millions off of poor workers from Nepal and other South Asian countries defrauding them by falsely selling them a dream of a better life In reply to the revelations Identity Malta insists that Single Permit applications pass through a rigorous due diligence process overseen by the agency JobsPlus and the Malta Police Force “Once an applicant is deemed to satisfy all requirements they are notified that they may proceed to Malta or to apply for a visa should they originate from a country which does not enjoy visa exemptions” Identity Malta said Moreover Identity Malta claimed that it periodically carries out verifications and inspections on its own initiative to assure that the presence of thirdcountry nationals in Malta is in line with the relevant permit “Each time it feels that a case drawn to its attention merits investigation or further actions Identity Malta refers the case to the authorities concerned It is not the first time that Identity Malta has referred such cases to the authorities and it has even been instrumental in breaking up networks that could have possibly been involved in human trafficking”

Mater Dei Hospital cleared of discrimination against Naged Megally,"April 10, 2023 3:31 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Court overturned a previous ruling which saw a doctor awarded compensation for being treated in an inhuman and degrading manner by the management of Mater Dei Hospital On Monday the Constitutional Court ruled that Naged Megally a doctor who has muscular dystrophy and formerly worked at the state hospital was not discriminated against albeit acknowledging that the case “could have been handled much better” The incident took place in July 2018 when Megally was working at the Mater Dei Ultrasound Clinic Megally who uses a wheelchair claimed that he was forcefully carried out of an examination room while treating patients by his superior Professor Yves Muscat Baron Muscat Baron had allegedly told Megally that he was taking too long and the medical equipment was needed by another doctor He was then forcefully removed from the room by being carried out and placed on a chair outside the clinic After complaining about his treatment then Mater Dei CEO Ivan Falzon threatened to dismiss Megally if he took the case any further and allegedly threatened to blackmail him with information in his possession about the doctor In June last year the First Hall of the Civil Court found for Megally ruling that he had suffered discriminatory treatment and ordered that he be immediately allowed to return to duty also ordering the health ministry to pay the obstetrician €5000 in compensation In October 2021 while his breach of rights case was ongoing he was suspended over alleged “mistakes” and “shortcomings” at his job Megally who is a specialist in fetal medicine has been working in the public health sector since 1993 He became a resident specialist at Mater Dei 11 years ago The Health Minister had ordered an internal inquiry however the inquiry board had dismissed the doctor’s complaint The applicant raised his concerns about the independence and impartiality of the board which handled his case A judicial protest was then filed on 29 August 2019 in which Megally demanded a copy of the report The doctor claimed that the defendants instead of fostering an inclusive environment his superiors felt comfortable enough to “persecute and mistreat” him Further there were attempts to terminate his work contract on the basis of his disability which was not a valid basis at law In light of such circumstances the doctor felt he had to seek redress through the constitutional court and instituted proceedings against the Health Minister and Mater Dei CEO The First Hall Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction presided over by Mr Justice Grazio Mercieca was informed about a concerted effort among medical consultants to dismiss Megally However that plan failed because one of the consultants stood up for Megally insisting that there was no cause for dismissal But the Minster for Health and Celia Falzon who had since become CEO of Mater Dei hospital appealed the judgment In its appeal hospital argued that from the testimony given by Muscat Baron it transpired that the events had not happened how Megally described them Muscat Baron had told court that he had suggested to Megally that it would be quicker were the other doctor be allowed to finish seeing his 10 patients before the plaintiff saw his three patients In addition Muscat Baron had said that Megally had been allocated a much smaller number of patients than his colleagues and that he had assumed this was because it was necessary due to his disability The witness also confirmed that after the incident in question happened the number of patients on the applicant’s list had increased substantially On her part Celia Falzon disagreed with the first court’s findings which had concluded that the hospital authorities had tried to dismiss Megally due to his disability arguing that the evidence appeared to show that this discussion had been prompted solely by serious concerns based on a number of complaints from the plaintiff’s patients regarding the performance of his duties The Court of Appeal presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti together with judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul however overturned the decision saying that it could not find any evidence to corroborate the plaintiff’s account of events “and on the contrary it appears that in the course of these proceedings this allegation was contradicted by the plaintiff himself” Although Megally had claimed that the incident had happened in front of a patient the plaintiff’s patient who had testified both in court and also in the hospital’s internal inquiry had made no mention of it and neither had any other patient come forward to confirm the plaintiff’s version of events The Court of Appeal also noted that although in his initial application Megally had claimed to have been physically removed from the room and not by the porters this account had changed in his subsequent affidavit where he claimed that Muscat Baron had wanted him to be taken out of the room but that Megally had refused to leave before the porters arrived This meant that the first court had been wrong to consider as proven the plaintiff’s allegation that he had been violently removed from the room the Constitutional Court said In their judgement the judges observed that from an examination of the acts it absolutely does not appear that there was any intention to humiliate the plaintiff What emerged from the documents said the court is that when the incident in question occurred a problem had arisen because one of the machines used for ultrasounds on pregnant women had stopped working The only working machine was being used by a doctor who had about 10 patients on his list while the plaintiff who had been using the other machine had a total of four At that time the plaintiff had been seeing fewer patients than his colleagues with the court rejecting the plaintiff’s assertion that this showed systematic discrimination It appears the situation had been like this for a number of years and during those years Megally had ever complained or clarified that he could see more patients than were being assigned to him The obstetrician was not paid less than his colleagues as a consequence of this reduced workload the court added His superiors who had inherited this system where Megally was assigned fewer patients were under the impression that this was due to his disability and had never confronted him about the number of patients he was seeing “Instead it seems that the situation had been accepted by everyone including the plaintiff without difficulty or complaint In the view of this Court all this shows that the hospital was taking steps to make the workplace more accessible for the plaintiff and not that the plaintiff was subject to any systematic discrimination” On the day in question the other doctor’s patients had been scheduled to have an anomaly scan an examination that had to be carried out in a specific short timeframe during the pregnancy said the court noting that it was imperative to avoid cancelling such appointments whenever possible “In the opinion of this Court in those particular circumstances the hospital was justified in its decision to give the plaintiff’s room to the other doctor because it seems that this decision was taken in the best interests of the patients which is always the priority of the hospital and the doctors who work in it” Megally should not have been ordered to leave room in front of patient However the Court of Appeal noted that the situation “could have been handled much better” stressing that Muscat Baron should not have ordered Megally to leave the room in front of a patient The professor’s indirect reference to Megally’s disability by pointing out that he took longer to examine his patients than the other doctor was “not aimed at humiliating the plaintiff or show any contempt towards him but was intended only to explain why it was necessary for the plaintiff to give up the room… in the best interest of the patients so as not to cancel the appointments that the other doctor had on his list” In the circumstances the court ruled that the incident at issue is not of the necessary severity to be considered as inhuman or degrading treatment adding that the plaintiff’s allegations about his treatment was not sufficiently proven The plaintiff had never complained about the limited number of patients that his clinic would be assigned and therefore Falzon and Muscat Baron had been justified in their assumption that he needed more time to attend to patients than the other doctor said the judges “Even if it were to be accepted that the plaintiff had been treated differently due to his disability the Court considers that such distinction in treatment was justified and proportionate in the circumstances of the case since the health and wellbeing of the patients is the priority of the Hospital’s administration and of all the doctors who work there including the plaintiff” The court also noted that the decision that the plaintiff be boarded out had not been based on his disability but on concerns about a number of serious mistakes on his part including telling a patient whose ultrasound had flagged a tumour that she was fine in one case and incorrectly telling another patient that she had lost her baby which mistake had only been discovered just before she was operated on to remove the remnants of the pregnancy in another The court also pointed to errors in Megally’s reading of anomaly scans where patients were given information which was the direct opposite of that actually resulting from these scans The plaintiff had been suspended pending an investigation by the Medical Council into the serious allegations and the first court should not have considered this suspension as proof of discrimination against him said the judges As those investigations were still ongoing the court said it could not interfere with this process before its completion “particularly since it does not even appear prima facie that this investigation is malicious and discriminatory” In light of all this the Court declared the doctor’s claim to have suffered discrimination to be unfounded and upheld the hospital’s appeal

New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”

Muscat revelations ‘textbook case of money laundering’ – Repubblika,"May 17, 2023 2:13 PM",Anticorruption NGO Repubblika has once again asked an inquiring magistrate to consider issuing an order for the arrest of people involved in the fraudulent hospital concession deal before they can flee the country and justice In a press conference outside the courthouse in Valletta Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said that the NGO filed an application demanding the inquiring magistrate to include the latest revelations published on Wednesday The application filed by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asks the magistrate to consider ordering the arrest of people involved in the deal with Aquilina reiterating that Repubblika is informed that “at least one or a number of people implicated in fraud corruption and other crimes that carry hefty sentences are making detailed preparations and possibly already putting in action plans to flee the country to dodge justice” Accusing disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat of “criminal association to launder money originating from corruption” Aquilina described it as a “textbook case of money laundering” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe into the hospitals’ deal which was requested by Repubblika in 2019 According to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta investigators are looking into payments Muscat received from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Aquilina said that the latest revelations show that Muscat granted a concession to VGH and these public funds were then passed on to a Swiss firm – Accutor AG – which in turn paid the former prime minister and another VGH investor “This gives off a very strong whiff of money laundering it seems that it is a textbook case of money laundering” Aquilina said According to The Times police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police The investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella In this regard Aquilina said the police chief “is the biggest obstacle for justice to prevail in our country” “From what we have found out this morning not only is Gafá is failing to fulfil his duties as police chief but he is also hindering magistrates who are carrying out their job in full respect of their oath” He added that hours after the publication of these revelations Gafá has “remained silent and has not denied anything”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul said Predictably he went on to suggest that the government would resist this and do the opposite

Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Industrial action by air traffic controllers temporarily suspended,"April 9, 2023 10:12 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Malta Air Traffic Controllers Association has temporarily suspended its industrial action which has been in place for the past three months Newsbookcommt is informed The decision to temporarily put the directives on hold was taken with the view of resuming talks on the negotiation of a new collective agreement with the Malta Air Traffic Services Ltd The directives were issued in January after talks fell through It is believed that directives will cost airline companies thousands of euros due to their impact on flights In turn this has also sparked harsh criticism due to landing delays since air traffic controllers are responsible for monitoring and directing the movement of aircraft on the ground and in the air Industry sources have said that the flight on which Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez who stopped in Malta as part of his preparatory tour before Spain takes over the Presidency of the Council of the EU was travelling was also affected The Spanish Prime Minister was left waiting midair before the aircraft was directed to land This information has been corroborated by the aircraft’s tracking data available through a flight tracking website In this case it shows that the aircraft was left waiting when normally flights carrying heads of state are given precedence over other flights when landing The industrial actions have been criticised by the CEO of Ryanair subsidiary MaltaAirDavid O’Brien who slammed the drectives as ‘misbehaviour’ and said they caused longer flights and fuel wastage Last month O’Brien said that these ‘unprofessional’ practices in the way aircraft were told to approach or take off from Malta were costing his airline and others added fuel costs He argued that if air traffic control wants to hold strikes it should not have an impact over flights
Easter is an invitation to renew ourselves – Archbishop,"April 9, 2023 9:21 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti As he celebrated Easter Archbishop Charles Scicluna urged the faithful to seek renewal to shed themselves of any arrogance sins and vices in favour of the pursuit of humility purity and righteousness On Sunday morning the Archbishop led a celebration of the Solemn Mass of the Resurrection of the Lord at the St John’s CoCathedral with the Gospel reading of the day appropriately being John’s account of the discovery of the empty tomb of Jesus In his homily however the Archbishop focused on the second reading a short excerpt of the First Epistle to the Corinthians in which St Paul recalling Jesus’ sacrifice urges Christians to celebrate not with bread leavened with the old yeast of “malice and wickedness” but with the “unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” “The Lord with the mystery of Easter cleanses us of all beliefs that we are superior to others that we alone have the right to judge or even condemn others” he said “May the leavening brought by the old yeast be cleansed from our heart” The Archbishop recalled that unleavened bread already had religious significance in Jesus’ time given its usage during the Jewish feast of Passover symbolising the bread the Jews prepared in haste as they left Egypt in a hurry to escape a life of slavery in pursuit of freedomOn Easter he added a similar invitation beckoned to the faithful “May we in our hearts find the haste to free ourselves from all forms of slavery and oppression and achieve true freedom” he said This true freedom the Archbishop added was represented in the symbolism of the unleavened bread and meant a pure heart that “understands feels and empathises a heart that works for justice peace and truth but always with love” “Let us pray as we celebrate the mystery of Easter – the resurrection of our Lord – that we are freed from any haughtiness or any attitude or arrogance that makes us despise other people that makes us think that we are the only righteous ones” the Archbishop said as he brought his homily to a close “And let us pray for the gift of purity in humility or righteousness in truth” While Easter is the most important celebration of the Catholic Church given its commemoration of a foundational event for Christianity the key liturgical celebration is not the Easter Sunday Mass but the Easter Vigil the first official celebration of the resurrection that takes place in the hours of darkness between Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday The Archbishop led the celebration the Easter Vigil at the St John’s CoCathedral on Saturday night making a similar call for renewal in his homily “Let us pray that this holy night can be an invitation to start anew for our country and for the world” he said “The Lord is inviting us not to give up to be filled with hope and his plans for us are gathered in the few words that the resurrected Lord tells the righteous women ‘Peace be with you do not be afraid” the Archbishop continued “May these two gifts – the gift of peace and the gift of freedom from all fear – be our reward and our solace this Easter” The Easter Vigil is also traditionally the mass in which adult converts are received into full communion with the Church and Saturday’s mass was no exception with Archbishop Scicluna administering the sacraments of Baptism Confirmation and Holy Communion to 12 catechumens hailing from Malta Albania China France Latvia Nepal Turkey and the UK

"No ethics breach by Aaron Farrugia, Standards Commissioner declares","April 8, 2023 3:58 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Commissioner for Standards in Public Life Joseph Azzopardi has refused to investigate Infrastructure Minister Aaron Farrugia for a breach of ethics This concerns the Minister’s failure to show up in Parliament to answer questions about a video showing a motorist being assaulted by two Transport Malta officials In his decision Commissioner Joseph Azzopardi said that the transport minister should have scheduled his meetings properly to ensure he could attend the session but declared that this did not amount to an ethics breach This decision was denounced by civil society NGO Repubblika which filed the request in November 2022 to have Farrugia investigated after the Minister despite being in the Parliament building failed to attend a parliament sitting on 15 November 2022 He was expected in Parliament to respond to questions on footage showing Transport Malta officials beating up a man in the middle of the road On that day the Parliamentary session had to be suspended after PN MP Ryan Callus alleged that Farrugia had escaped from Parliament to avoid answering questions about the video In its statement Repubblika said the Commissioner’s own findings showed that Farrugia had breached the ministerial code of ethics and accused him of trying to protect the minister from censure In his findings the Commissioner noted that the ministerial code of ethics only permits ministers and parliamentary secretaries to skip parliament if they are abroad or unwell However Parliament’s standing orders also allows MPs to skip parliament if they are occupied with official government work Commissioner Azzopardi decided to lean upon that standing order in his decision “Given standing order 158 I cannot reasonably conclude that there is a breach of ethics if a minister absents himself from parliament due to government work provided they inform the party whip It is then up to the whip to inform the speaker” the Commissioner concluded He noted that while Farrugia was not clear in his message to his party whip and had scheduled a meeting that clashed with his parliamentary duties the minister’s indecision did not amount to a breach of ethics given that he communicated with his party whip as required by standing order 158 Repubblika insisted that poor planning did not excuse a breach as it went on to accuse the Standards Commissioner of “burying” the case “It appears that Prime Minister Robert Abela is succeeding in neutralizing the Standards Commissioner and turning the Office into a tool to protect his impunity and that of his colleagues” the NGO said

PM flouts parliament rules to react to hospitals report before anyone can read it,"May 15, 2023 6:46 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela was so keen to respond to the National Audit Office’s damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it properly that he chose to openly flout parliamentary procedure to do so Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on a report that appears to be an embarrassment to his government saw him bring it up in Parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon the government rejected its suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In the absence of an agreement Parliament continued with its scheduled debate on the financial estimates of the Environment and Resources Authority while the Nationalist Party scheduled an urgent press conference for 530pm at Parliament House But just as the PN’s press conference was about to begin – in timing that could hardly be considered coincidental – Abela chose to participate in the ERA debate to react to the report In doing so he was clearly out of order and in breach of parliamentary procedure as repeatedly highlighted by PN leader Bernard Grech and other MPs in points of order that they raised But while speaker Anġlu Farrugia accepted that Abela was in breach of procedure Malta’s longestserving speaker proved unable or unwilling to intervene His repeated appeals to Abela fell on deaf ears and Farrugia opted against taking further action While no journalist had been given the opportunity to read the 450page report properly before Abela launched his speech – the report was only made public around an hour earlier – the initial reports by Maltese newsrooms seized on the AuditorGeneral’s conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over a deal with Steward Health Care which obliged the government to pay the company €100 million if the hospitals contract was annulled But Abela – who was legal adviser to his predecessor Joseph Muscat when this controversial agreement was reached – made no reference to this or any reference to Mizzi or Muscat at all Instead he focused on a limited defence on what took place when he became PM in 2020 and insisted that he was actually pleased with the findings of the report because for all the problems identified with the concession the report did not identify any misconduct on the part of his own government Consequently he argued he and his government were “serene” even if his insistence on reacting to a report before anyone could actually read it suggested an entirely different scenario Abela also referred to Grech’s decision last week to call on police commissioner Angelo Gafà to investigate him in connection with the hospitals deal insisting that the NAO report made clear that this gambit made no sense as it lacked any credibility As he did so he also drew comparison with a previous criminal complaint targeting his government that made by Repubblika in the wake of the death of a group of asylum seekers in Malta’s searchandrescue area and reports alleging the intentional sabotage of a rubber boat As he had then Abela complained that the PN – he had made no distinction between the party and the activist group three years ago and did not do so on Monday – wanted to send him to prison But in doing so the selfdescribed progressive political leader also reiterated antimigrant rhetoric that would generally be considered to be the preserve of farright politicians describing Malta’s actions in 2020 as a reaction to “increased infections” caused by asylum seekers There is no suggestion that asylum seekers – which are in any case detained at length on arrival through Malta’s controversial detention policy described as “arbitrary” by the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner  – had contributed to the spread of Covid19 or other infections at the time In fact Abela’s government at the time had even taken the unorthodox – and highly questionable from a human rights perspective – step of housing asylum seekers for weeks on end on pleasure boats that were patently unfit for this purpose Abela’s speech predictably derailed the discussion with the next PN MPs to speak taking his cue to disregard the agenda of the day to react to his comments Grech and former PN leader Adrian Delia both described Abela’s actions as an attempt to control the narrative on a scandal before anyone could reasonably read the report The PN leader dismissed the impression Abela sought to portray describing the NAO report as “yet another confirmation that the Labour governments of Joseph Muscat and Robert Abela are accomplices to the greatest fraud this country has ever witnessed” He insisted that Abela’s decision to speak at the same time the PN’s press conference was taken place was a new “abyss” for Abela which testified to the fact that he is “confused weak and compromised” words he has used to describe Abela in recent weeks Grech was also adamant that the air of serenity Abela was seeking to project was a façade and that the PM was clearly preoccupied by the latest developments “He promised continuity” Grech said in reference to remarks Abela nade when he

Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over hospitals concession deal – NAO,"May 15, 2023 5:41 PM",Former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval a damning NAO audit shows The new audit report states that Mizzi acted in “haste” and the transfer was authorised “unilaterally” without “the appropriate sanction” by the Cabinet of ministers The requests by VGH were only discussed in Cabinet on 9 January 2018 “days after the approvals” by the then tourism minister had already been granted the report says After racking up €36 million in debts VGH then agreed to transfer the contract to Steward Healthcare for a reported €1 The report also belies disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s claims that all decisions taken on the hospitals deal were taken by his Cabinet of ministers Speaking in the aftermath of the court judgment that annulled the concession agreement in February Muscat had claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and collective decisions by the Cabinet Mizzi is also accused of having misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” “The delegation of responsibility for a health concession to the Minister for Tourism was deemed illogical by the NAO and provided a convenient opportunity for the exploitation of Government creating weakness where there ought to have been none a weakness all to readily leveraged by the SHC” “The most evident exploitation was that secured by the SHC in terms of Government’s liability to pay €100000000 and the sum of the lenders’ debt to the Concessionaire in case of courtdeclared nullity of the concession agreements irrespective of the party attributed the default a situation precipitated by the Minister for Tourism and engineered through his misleading of Cabinet Compounding matters was that Cabinet’s authorisation was not sought by the Minister for Tourism in instances when Government acted as guarantor in several financing agreements entered into by the SHC and the BOV” In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months This came after former PN leader Adrian Delia opened a court case in 2018 in a bid to force the cancellation of the 99year emphyteutical concession agreement on the basis that the original concessionaire VGH and their heirs in title Steward Healthcare had not fulfilled their contractual obligations Depasquale had harsh words for all parties involved in the deal including government concessionaires VGH and Steward Healthcare and in a scathing sentence said government had failed to protect the national interest in the privatisation deal In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement” Defying all logic the judge said Mizzi granted VGH another three years automatically extendable for another year and a half that is four and a half years in total ie until the end of the year 2022 to do what they had failed to do by September 2018 The judge also pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back The latest report was tabled in parliament on Monday afternoon Government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament holds an urgent debate on the report published by the NAO But the Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO’s findings Moreover the National Audit Office expressed great concern that Mizzi refused to collaborate during the probe “It is with the gravest concern that the NAO views the failure of the Minister for Tourism to cooperate in this audit as inexcusable compounded no less by the centrality of his role in the concession The shirking of accountability on the part of the Minister for Tourism hampered this Office in its understanding of the initial developments that led to the concession being taken over by the SHC and impacted other aspects for which he assumed responsibility in relation thereto most notably in authorising the change of control and in representing Government as guarantor for funds secured by the SHC” In addition the NAO said it could not verify assertions made by others regarding the role played by Mizzi in this concession “The NAO holds a bleak view of the Minister for Tourism’s conduct in this respect for ministers of Government and public officials who have acted in the interests of the Government should find no difficulty in accounting for their decisions and actions The action on the part of the Minister for Tourism in not cooperating with the NAO was deemed deplorable”
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Patients ‘should not bear the burden of industrial actions’ – Malta Health Network,"April 7, 2023 7:14 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Malta Health Network insisted that patients and their relatives should not bear the burden of industrial actions and disputes in the health sector with no sign of a resolution to a longrunning dispute between the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses and the government The government and the MUMN have been in negotiations over a new sectoral agreement since last August but little if any progress has occurred as a result Late last month the union ordered industrial actions highlighting that its suggestions were being disregarded and that it was only being offered “humiliating” counteroffers as it did so In a reaction to this development which has been leading to the postponement of planned medical procedures in the state healthcare system the Malta Health Network – which strives to promote the health interests of patients and the wider community – lamented that “after 8 months we are back to square one” “In the month when we promote Patients’ Rights it is very opportune to remind all and appeal for the safeguarding of Patients’ rights It is essential to uphold patients’ rights to ensure that they continue to receive safe and effective healthcare MHN appeals to all parties involved to uphold their duty and observe the rights of all patients while always ensuring their safety and dignity regardless of the circumstances Open communication with patients and providing them with necessary information during such times should be a priority” the organisation said The MHN endorsed a recent statement by the Office of the Ombudsman’s Commissioner for Health which urged for a resolution of the situation In line with the commissioner’s own statement the MHN chose not to blame either party to the dispute instead urging both to strive to resolve the issues between them “It is utterly unfair and unsafe for patients to be made to suffer at the expense of such situations and is also an emotional burden for many healthcare workers who have their patients’ best interests at heart The bottom line is that ultimately we are ALL patients or relatives of patients at some point in our lives and we ALL appreciate that our health and wellbeing supported by health care services is the most important thing in our lives” it said

"When the innocent suffer, the Passion is still with us – Archbishop","April 7, 2023 3:15 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Passion is still with us whenever the innocent suffer and whenever the cruelty of people appears to prevail Archbishop Charles Scicluna said on Good Friday The Archbishop was making a reflection during the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord at the St John’s CoCathedral on Good Friday the only day in the liturgical calendar in which no mass is celebrated The celebration consists of three parts – the liturgy of the word the veneration of the cross and the Holy Communion – with the Archbishop making his reflection after the Gospel reading John’s account of the Passion “As we remember the Passion of our Lord I wish that we remember that this tragic moment in the history of humanity is in many ways still with us today” he said “It is with us whenever the innocent suffer through no fault of their own it is with us whenever there are victims of injustice it is with us whenever the innocent are killed be they men or women and with us whenever the cruelty of people appears to prevail” But as the Passion itself shows the Archbishop explained this was not the end of the story drawing on the first reading made during the celebration Isaiah’s prophecy on the suffering and glory of the “servant” which Jesus’ passion and resurrection are held to be a fulfilment of to make his point In the prophecy the servant is held to have done no wrong facing punishment for “our transgressions… our iniquities” but the same punishment redeems everyone and “by his wounds we are healed” But in the end the servant also sees glory the prophecy foretells that “he will see his descendants and prolong his days” The Archbishop highlighted that the faithful had a role to play in fulfilling this prophecy asking “what descendants can we speak of if not ourselves and how can his days be prolonged if not through our deeds” Mgr Scicluna added that the “community that believes” had to recognise that it often strayed from the path as it followed Jesus and may not always emulate him “But today we ask for His grace so that we can also be a presence of light a presence that gives hope” he continued Archbishop Scicluna then concluded his reflections with a short prayer “Let us pray so that we who are redeemed by Jesus’ blood recognise how precious it is and live the life of those who wish to be Jesus’ descendants who prolong the days of this servant of God silent suffering and victorious” he said “We pray to you and bless you because with your cross you have redeemed us all”

NGOs slam ‘detached’ animal welfare minister Anton Refalo,"April 7, 2023 1:10 PM",Animal rights NGOs accused minister Anton Refalo of being detached from reality accusing him and the Labour administration of neglecting the sector for a decade Reacting to Refalo’s comments in a recent interview the NGOs listed a long line of unkept promises despite the animal welfare minister’s claims that things have drastically improved since 2013 “Hearing Dr Refalo one would be under the impression that the Labour Administration has just come into power and inherited an Animal Welfare Department under distress” the NGOs said adding “Labour has been in office for 10 years and this should have had enough time to plan and implement any changes required” The current inadequacies they said “are clearly the responsibility of this administration that allowed the Animal Welfare Department to become the Cinderella department” Accusing Refalo of being completely detached from the reality “that shelters encounter every day that activists see and must handle personally on a daily basis and a reality that the state has and is ignoring” the NGO said the department needs urgent reform “The only responsible comment from the Minister should have been that the situation is dire and it is time for serious action If the Minister had to wear a pair of boots for a few couple of days and feel the daily realities faced by shelters and activists he would realise that the glass is not half full as he said but completely empty” Describing the situation at the Animal Welfare Department as “dire” the NGOs said that the desperate lack of resources mean that it must choose which animals to be confiscated or picked up from the streets and the ones that unfortunately have to be left where they are until conditions improve Among others the NGOs said plans for a national animal rescue centre at Ta’ Qali that was announced years ago is still in the ‘pipeline’ and such a project has yet to start They added that a spate of other measures promised were discussed but never materialised  including legislation to regulate breeders legislation to regulate and licence pet sitters groomers and trainers and legislation on zoos that was issued and withdrawn immediately after protests from zoo owners The NGOs also pointed out that the Labour administration has failed to deliver the promised legislation against the isolation of dogs and regulations to make microchipping of cats obligatory Moreover the NGOs underlined a series of operational inadequacies such as the proper and effective enforcement of laws and the failure to provide Animal Welfare staff with proper equipment and training in animal handling Government has also failed to properly fine and prosecute people who abandon mistreat and create unnecessary pain to animals they said while noting the lack of a nationwide neutering campaign especially needed for stray cats and dogs They also called for more space for abandoned animals the basic training of Animal Welfare employees “to properly answer” the 1717 helpline and the need for specially designed vehicles to transport animals Taking a swipe at Refalo the NGOs said “it would be wrong for us to state that nothing has happened The minister can be credited for the following While saying that one of the few positive steps taken by the Labour administration has been the appointment of Alison Bezzina as Commissioner for Animal Welfare the NGOs noted that although microchipping for dogs has been mandatory since 2012 “however till this date many dogs that are picked up surrendered or confiscated are not microchipped” “This is mainly since no proper protocols are in place and people are not being fined or prosecuted for their actions” they said On the recent amendments to the Animal Welfare Act which activists have dubbed the ‘Refalo Animal Circus Act’ the NGOs said this “did not improve the welfare of the animals nor their rights especially when circuses using animals might be approved under the discretion of the VRD Director This concern has been raised more than once and as usual was ignored and the final decision was taken in favour of ‘profit’ and not animal welfare” “The fact that the same minister that is responsible for animal welfare is lobbying against the changes that will happen after 14 million Europeans signed to end the cage age and is advocating the continued suffering of animals in cages makes us seriously question if this is a Minister for Animal Welfare” they asked Refalo they added “also mentions that he will be putting forward to parliament changes to the law regarding the size of animal pens Again after the fiasco of the Refalo Animal Circus Act the government has not learnt the important lesson that there should be public consultation especially with animal NGOs and activists” The PR has been endorsed by Association for Abandoned Animals AAA Buddy’s lost and found page Fostering and Homing Paws

Occupy Justice demands reopening of Egrant inquiry,"May 17, 2023 9:39 AM",Activists from Occupy Justice staged a protest outside Castille on Tuesday evening calling for the Egrant inquiry to be reopened “The reopening of the Egrant Inquiry is long overdue You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves for ignoring this History will not be kind to you for betraying those you were duty bound to serve and protect  Take action or resign” the activists warned Robert Abela’s administration In September 2021 Magistrate Ian Farrugia called for the reopening of Egrant inquiry  However to date the Attorney General has failed to take any action In spite of recent revelations regarding the Egrant Inquiry and all the dirty manoeuvres by Pilatus Bank officials and employees Occupy Justice said “there hasn’t been so much as a peep of action from the Floriana Police Depot or the Attorney General’s office” The magisterial inquiry into Pilatus Bank ordered that the Egrant inquiry be reopened after finding reasonable suspicion that 11 million were transferred from Azerbaijan to an account at Pilatus Bank through a parallel and secretive accounting system Murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had claimed that Egrant was owned by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s wife Michelle and the company received a payment of US1017 from Leyla Aliyeva daughter of Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev The Muscats vehemently deny these allegations An inquiry ordered by Muscat had found no evidence linking him and his wife to the secret Panama company but the owner remains unknown to this day “Whilst they’re dragging their feet and coming up with excuses to justify their inaction making sure that justice is delayed criminals roam free and are gifted years of a headstart to cover their tracks It seems that our institutions are spinelessly hell bent in protecting fraudsters and corrupt individuals instead of investigating them” Occupy Justice said Reminding finance minister Clyde Caruana that on 1 November 2019 he pledged to make available all necessary resources should there be ‘a request’ to reopen the Egrant Inquiry Occupy Justice said “that request was made by Magistrate Ian Farrugia who called for it to be reopened The Attorney General was legally obliged to comply with Magistrate Farrugia’s order Instead this was ignored – not that we’ve come to expect better from this office” “Well here we are making the request again We’re also demanding that this time round the terms for the Inquiry are not drafted by the prime suspect in the case It is laughable that this happened in the first place” They added that the contempt with which the Labour administration has treated the Maltese people for these past ten years is unprecedented “using its privilege and power to shield those who should have faced justice years ago All this makes us wonder as to who is really pulling the strings”
"Repubblika demands arrest of Muscat, Mizzi to prevent them from fleeing","May 16, 2023 3:07 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Repubblika asked the magistrate conducting an inquiry into the hospitals privatisation deal with Vitals Global Healthcare to take note of the damning Auditor General report on the concession and if necessary order the immediate arrest of people who are preparing to abscond In comments to Newsbookcommt Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said “we asked the inquiring magistrate to tale all the necessary action to prevent anyone involved in the ruse from fleeing the country” He added that court must order the arrest of anyone who could be preparing to abscond as he named former disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and former Labour ministers Konrad Mizzi and Chris Cardona The NGO also asked the magistrate to grant immunity to whoever was involved in the deal and is prepared to reveal their accomplices The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In a press conference outside the Valletta courthouse on Tuesday afternoon Aquilina underlined a number of findings in the NAO report including the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” between Muscat and Mizzi Among others Aquilina said the NAO report found that Muscat and Mizzi’s actions hindered health minister Chris Fearne’s ability to negotiate with Steward Healthcare SHC “The reluctance of the Minister for Tourism to step back from interactions with the SHC was detrimental to the Government’s interests for it created a weakness in its position all to evident to the SHC a weakness that – based on that noted by the Minister for Health – was readily exploited” the NAO said Aquilina also pointed out that Muscat and Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers over the agreement that saw government act as guarantor of Steward Healthcare’s loan from Bank of Valletta While noting the “complicity” between former prime minister Joseph Muscat and Mizzi to mislead the Cabinet of ministers Repubblika asked the inquiring magistrate to order the Attorney General to issue an exemption from prosecution under the Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act for persons involved in the deal who are willing to reveal their accomplices Aquilina explained that former VGH director Ram Tumuluri had wanted to spill the beans on the secret deal adding that the report concluded that Tumuluri had been pressured in to transferring his shares to Steward The application filed this morning by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asked the magistrate to prevent further destruction of the evidence and prevent the suspects from leaving the island with Aquilina saying that Repubblika was informed that preparations to abscond were already underway Describing the concession as an “obscene ruse” Aquilina said the NAO report also highlights the involvement of Muscat’s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi’s then permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi The NAO report Aquilina added states that Muscat and Mizzi’s ploy to mislead the Cabinet of ministers would not have been possible without Ronald Mizzi’s involvement In 2019 Repubblika had filed an application demanding a criminal probe into the VGH deal after the Criminal Court had quashed an order to hold a magisterial inquiry placing disgraced former ministers Konrad Mizzi Edward Scicluna and Chris Cardona under magisterial scrutiny Cardona had signed a memorandum of understanding with VGH in October 2014 months before a request for proposals was even issued for the concession to operate three of Malta’s state hospitals Repubblika had demanded a criminal probe to establish if there was criminal complicity by three ministers in the controversial contract which was then annulled by court in February 2023 In their application the activists had accused the three ministers of facilitating a “coordinated” “act of modernday piracy” “corruption and money laundering among other crimes” which saw VGH’s investor leave a debt of €50 million
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"Following illegal demolitions, developer seeks to turn Villa St Ignatius into hotel","April 7, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A developer is planning to turn the historic Villa St Ignatius in Balluta into a hotel – with the addition of several floors above and below – over five years after demolishing a large part of the historic landmark in violation of a court order These demolition works had taken place on December 2017 and appeared to be a cynical reaction to an application to schedule the historic property which was submitted by NGO Din lArt Ħelwa only days earlier Din lArt Ħelwa then instituted court proceedings with the court ruling in April 2018 that contempt of court proceedings should be initiated against developer Paul Gauci his architect Stephen Vancell and the Planning Authority’s enforcement chief over the affair The PA’s MapServer shows that no enforcement case was ever opened concerning the site even after the whole controversy But Gauci now using the services of architect Antoine Zammit filed a fresh planning application last August which has since finalised screening and which was published in the Government Gazette this month paving the way for objections to be filed until 8 May Even Gauci’s brazen demolition works had failed to convince the PA of the need to protect the historic structure DLĦ’s request for scheduling was turned down even as a cluster of adjacent townhouses and the neighbouring St Ignatius Church – all of which were erected decades later– received this protection The church is a Grade 1 scheduled structure while the townhouses are scheduled at Grade 2 All face Old College Street a name which itself recalls Villa St Ignatius’ past use as a college An extensive report DLĦ had prepared to accompany its unsuccessful application to schedule the structure prepared by architect and heritage consultant Edward Said highlights its storied history and arguably renders questionable the PA’s refusal to afford it any protection The villa was originally known as BelVedere and was once the large country villa of a wealthy English merchant by the name of John Watson It is perhaps the oldest extant structure in Balluta preceding even the first Carmelite church in the area which was built in 1858 and was surrounded by its own extensive gardens – which stretched all the way to the sea and which are now largely builtup – and fields In 1846 the property was bought by the English Missionary Association to house a facility that would train Anglican missionaries and the Malta Protestant College was born This college remained in operation until 1865 and was soon purchased by three Maltese men who appeared intent on countering what they perceived as an undesirable spread of Protestantism in an overwhelmingly Catholic island This motivated them to invite English Jesuits to run a college paving the way for the opening of St Ignatius College in 1877 The church was completed four years later along with extensions to the original structure to accommodate the school and boarders The college ended up closing its doors in 1907 and a Birkirkara complex which housed young Jesuits in their formative years soon became its effective successor taking up the name St Aloysius College Now known as Villa St Ignatius the Balluta building remained vacant until 1915 when it became a military hospital treating soldiers injured during the Great War this closed down in 1919 While the church continued serving the community the rest of the college was ultimately divided into tenements while its grounds were progressively sold off to make way for development most notably the Balluta Buildings But as Said observed “the entire fabric of the old college including the villa building of Watson’s BelVedere still survive intact although naturally altered to adapt for the different exigencies spanning well over a century and a half” Or at least they did until the illegal demolition works took place Gauci’s application comes with a lengthy description proposing the “rehabilitation” of Villa St Ignatius and the development of a 64room 4star hotel with ancillary amenities The proposed works include the reinstatement of the villa’s front annex on Triq Scicluna – the same annex which Gauci had demolished – along with restoration works to the villa It also proposes the demolition of a number of accretions to the site But the complex would also see extensive additions not least the addition of three floors above the villa to house the hotel rooms and suits Gauci is also proposing the construction of two additional structures on the grounds a sixfloor structure comprising a twofloor multipurpose hall and four floors of suites as well as a side block with an exhibition space at ground floor and three floors of hotel rooms and suites They would replace what are described as “newer constructed blocks adjacent to the villa and recent accretions” according to the application The designs submitted to the PA show that the new additions would be modern concrete constructions and not reflect the villa’s original neoGothic appearance As such they would appear to be designs that would have likely been unworkable had the villa received the scheduling sought by DLĦ Grade 2 scheduling would only allow alterations that are carried out “sensitively” and which cause the least detriment to the building’s “character and architectural homogeneity” while Grade 1 scheduling effectively rules out such additions outright
15-year-old arrested after leading police on car chase,"April 6, 2023 7:57 PM",A 15yearold boy was arrested by the police in the small hours of Thursday morning shortly after he was allegedly involved in stealing from a number of fishing boats in Marsaxlokk The police were alerted to a theft taking place from a fishing boat in Xatt isSajjieda at around 140am and were provided with a description of the alleged getaway car This description proved crucial as the very same car was identified within minutes being driven in Cospicua But as soon as the driver noticed the presence of police officers he attempted to escape by driving at high speed towards them an officer was almost hit in the process This attempt to flee proved futile with the police chasing the vehicle through several streets before successfully bringing it to a stop and arresting the driver who was found to be a minor A search of the car yielded a number of items reported stolen from Marsaxlokk boats as well as two sachets containing a substance that is suspected to be cocaine Police investigations into the incident are still ongoing
Love must be measure of all that we do – Archbishop,"April 6, 2023 5:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Archbishop Charles Scicluna urged the faithful to consider love to be the measure of all their thoughts words and actions and the manner in which they can live in harmony with God as he celebrated the Mass of the Lord’s Supper at the St John’s CoCathedral on Thursday evening The service which is held on the evening of Maundy Thursday inaugurates the Easter Triduum the threeday observance that recalls the passion crucifixion death burial and eventual resurrection of Jesus The Triduum reaches its culmination with the Easter Vigil on Saturday – the most important mass in the Catholic liturgical calendar – and is brought to a close with evening prayers on Easter Sunday It serves to commemorate the Last Supper of Jesus and accordingly the Gospel reading of the day is John’s account of Jesus washing his disciples’ feet during this evening meal – a ritual that bishops emulate by washing the feet of the faithful during the mass The Archbishop was no exception to this rule he proceeded to wash the feet of various children women and men after he delivered his homily Mgr Scicluna began the ritual by washing the feet of ALS Malta founder Bjorn Formosa and proceeded to wash the feet of people who attend the soup kitchen run by Franciscan friars in Valletta In his homily the Archbishop reflected on the significance of this ritual and emphasised the importance of the words which close the Gospel reading Jesus telling his disciples “I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you” after washing their feet Jesus as the Archbishop observed had just highlighted that the disciples rightly called him ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’ but this did not mean that he should be above such a gesture The passage Mgr Scicluna said made clear that this “beautiful ritual” was a gesture of love and served as a reminder to the faithful that “love must be the measure of all that we think all that we say all that we do” “If we are to understand whether we are living in harmony with Jesus we must continually ask ourselves” he continued “Is what I am thinking about this person coming from a place of love If what I am about to say an expression of love And are my actions a gesture of love Or something else” Recalling the significance of the Holy Week in the liturgical calendar the Archbishop urged the faithful to seek forgiveness for those occasions when their own loves and their quests for justice truth and beauty are tarnished by rage jealousy passions and egoism He encouraged prayers so that the Lord can purify people’s love and make it resemble his own And in this spirit he urged everyone to pray that they are not afraid to symbolically wash each other’s feet “We pray today that we all according to our vocation find the strength humility courage and serenity to give ourselves with great dedication and a sense of service in every circumstance and are not afraid to wash each other’s feet” “Let us pray that the Lord blesses us with wisdom with light with discernment so that in all that we think all that we say and all that we do there is Him there is love”
Boaters protest as cruise liners set to muscle out traditional dgħajsa tal-pass,"April 6, 2023 4:56 PM",A Grand Harbour tradition going back centuries – boatmen barklori ferrying passengers between Valletta and Cottonera on the dgħajsa talpass – risks being snuffed out through a planned expansion of the cruise liner terminal that appears to make no allowance for the traditional and picturesque boats In the face of this development and without even the suggestion of an alternative landing site being provided the boatmen took their colourful boats to the existing landing site near Customs House on Thursday afternoon to protest the injustice they face “The barklori have been operating from the landing site in front of Customs House since the time of the Knights” the Għaqda talBarklori observed in a statement released for the occasion But the planned expansion of Pinto Wharf to accommodate even more cruise liners is set to take over this landing site and beyond The planned expansion is covered by development permit PA757022 which was granted to Infrastructure Malta last February and for which a commencement notice was issued last month This permit was a renewal of a previous one PA410816 which was granted in 2018 and left to expire The permit covers the “extension of Pinto Quays 4 and 5 including insertion of two new bollards and two new lighting masts” according to its description But Infrastructure Malta’s plans do not appear to make any allowance for the centuriesold trade of the barklori who say that the agency has “refused and failed to include in their multi million euro project an alternative landing site from which our clients can be expected to operate safely” “Despite various attempts to communicate with authorities and bring the growing concern to their attention no alternative has been provided by Infrastructure Malta” they added Their protest follows IM’s commencement of preparatory works for pit holes that they plan to dig up on the wharf which are already set to severely disrupt the operations of the dgħajsa talpass The barklori pointed out that works were initiated less than a meter away from where passengers disembarked IM has also placed a barge which is now moored on part of the landing site effectively closing off access to the jetty where passengers disembark “This has all been done without the consent or consultation of the barklori putting at risk their rights Malta’s cultural heritage and their earnings” the boatmen said The Għaqda talBarklori pledged that the boatmen would continue to protest until the authorities agree to find a solution “that makes sense” They are also insisting that until a permanent solution is found they should be provided with a temporary alternative site which is sufficiently sheltered and thus does not endanger them or their passengers Moreover this alternative should be in place before work on the terminal extension resumes The boatmen are also insisting on an agreement in writing “that guarantees us a permanent landing site which has been agreed to by all parties that respects Malta’s cultural heritage our work and our rights” In a reaction to the protest the opposition’s transport spokesperson Adrian Delia said that there was little to add to what the boatman had said because “their pain speaks for itself” he thus chose to reproduce their statement in full

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

New EU tax on aviation fuel will affect price of Maltese exports – Peter Agius,"April 5, 2023 8:17 PM",A new tax that is being proposed by the EU on aviation fuel will affect the prices of up to 90 of Maltese exports Thus islands like Malta need a systemic and permanent safeguard for the Green deal to succeed This was stated by PN candidate for the MEP elections Peter Agius who warned that the government’s weakness in negotiations in Brussels risks jobs and further inflation In a statement Agius said that the new EU rules that are currently being discussed in the Council of Ministers in Brussels would if adopted impose excise duties on aviation fuel impacting up to 90 of exports of goods from Malta and up to 85 of imports According to Agius Malta has up to 90 of its goods for export and 85 of its imports transported through ‘mixed’ flights arrangements “This is unacceptable as it sets Malta at a further competitive disadvantage when compared to mainland Europe Additionally manufacturing jobs will come under more pressure from competition inside the EU itself as well as outside” he insisted The proposed EU Directive on Energy Taxation plans to introduce new excise duties on the transport of goods by air In a move to avoid setting EU air operators at a disadvantage with US counterparts the draft Directive foresees exemptions for ‘all cargo’ flights but do not foresee such exemptions for ‘mixed’ flights where cargo is transported with passengers “Malta is expected to pay the highest price among EU member states Virtually all goods imported and exported to and from Malta would be subject to excise duties on fuel starting from 2028 The situation is different in mainland Europe where the lion’s share of goods movements is done through ‘all cargo’ flights or through road transport Malta will hence be disproportionately affected” he said “This calls for a differentiated approach on the negotiating table in the Council of Ministers Islands like Malta need a systemic and permanent safeguard mechanism if the Green deal is to succeed Fighting climate change is in all our interest but it cannot come at a disproportionate cost for islands’ competitiveness further compounding their insularity” he added Agius called on the Maltese Government to work for an alliance of islands “We need a systemic and permanent mechanism that recognises the particular challenges of islands when it comes to road and air transport Malta needs to lead an alliance of islands with a firm stance for the protection of island economies”

Government sides with hunting lobby on opening of spring hunting season,"April 5, 2023 5:11 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The government has filed a reply to a prohibitory injunction filed in Court by BirdLife Malta arguing that the Courts ought to reject BirdLife’s request to stop the spring hunting season from opening The prohibitory injunction was requested by the eNGO in an attempt to prevent government from issuing the legal notice that would effectively open the spring hunting season for the vulnerable turtledove On his Facebook page Gozo Minister Clint Camilleri said that in its reply the government  argued that the requisites for the issue of the mandate were not satisfied and consequently the Court ought to reject BirdLife’s request The hearing on the prohibitory injunction was appointed for 18 April 2023 meaning that the season will not be opened as planned until a decision by the Court is made Last year BirdLife filed a prohibitory injunction but this was rejected by the Court over a technicality BirdLife had filed a prohibitory injunction after the legal notice opening the spring hunting season was already published “The main difference is that this time the injunction is being requested to stop the legal notice from being issued whereas that of last year was filed after the legal notice was published In fact this was the main technical argument which the State Advocate had insisted upon and that was accepted by Judge Demicoli leading her to decide the case against BirdLife Malta at that time” BirdLife said on Tuesday The time the action was filed by BirdLife after the Ornis Committee voted in favour of opening the hunting season for this year with BirdLife saying that the turtledove is a vulnerable species and thus should not be hunted during spring The spring season is a particularly sensitive period for the bird as it passes over Malta while it heads to Europe to breed after having spent the winter season in the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert Hunting this bird during spring means that it is unable to procreate putting this species at risk Last week the Ornis Committee approved a proposal by the hunting lobby to allow the hunting of turtle doves and quail this spring “This means quail hunting from 10 to 30 April 2023 and turtle dove hunting from 17 to 30 April 2023 both days included for both seasons The times of hunting are from two hours before sunrise to midday of each day of the seasons  The national bag quotas also remain the same as last year’s that is 2400 for quail and 1500 for turtle doves” the hunting lobby group FKNK said The Ornis Committee was established for the purpose of advising the Gozo Minister who is responsible for hunting on a range of matters concerning conservation of wild birds including the parameters of any bird hunting seasons authorisation of derogations and monitoring of their implementation policies related to conservation of wild birds scientific studies and similar matters The committee will now recommend to the hunting minister to apply derogation from the EU Directive known as the “Birds directive” to permit turtle dove and quail hunting this spring on the same parameters of the 2022 spring hunting season Malta has authorised derogations for the hunting of quail since 2011 and the livecapturing of golden plover and song thrush since 2012 and also failed to establish a general system of protection of wild birds against illegal killing and capturing The European Commission has repeatedly given notice to Malta to correctly apply the Birds Directive which requires a general system of protection for wild birds and allows derogations only subject to strict conditions The European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aim for the EU to halt biodiversity loss by protecting and restoring nature BirdLife has protested this decision by Ornis Committee saying that Prime Minister Robert Abela must shoulder the responsibility of opening a season on the Vulnerable European turtledove despite the additional infringement proceedings announced by the European Commission against Malta only a few weeks ago on this derogation The decision by the Ornis Committee to allow the hunting of turtledoves in spring also disregards the fact that Malta is facing several infringement procedures initiated by the European Commission according to BirdLife Malta On Wednesday morning hunting lobby group FKNK filed an appeal in Court requesting that the FKNK be authorized to participate and make its submissions in the injunction mandate procedures BirdLife Malta brought against the Government The lobby group emphasised that BirdLife’s request goes against the recommendation of the Ornis Committee

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Court upholds decision to disqualify Christian Borg’s company from leasing tender for judiciary,"April 5, 2023 11:08 AM",The Appeals Court has upheld a decision by the Public Contracts Review Board to disqualify Christian Borg’s company from a multimillioneuro car leasing tender for the judiciary The judgment also confirms that Borg was contracted to supply cars to the Commissioner of Police and other governmental entities On Tuesday Newsbookcommt revealed that the police did not award any tenders to Borg or any of his companies however they leased out cars from him whenever they are needed for undercover operations Asked by this newsroom on the matter the Malta Police Force would not confirm nor deny if it has leased vehicles from Borg or any of his associated companies to be used in undercover operations and when foreign official delegations are in Malta Princess Operations Ltd – a company that is solely owned by Christian Borg a man charged with a botched kidnapping and allegedly subjected to a money laundering investigation – was last year awarded a lucrative €26 million contract for the Lease of 48 plugin hybrid vehicles for members of the judiciary Borg’s bid was the cheapest out of three but the offer was deemed “administratively noncompliant” by the selection committee thus disqualifying it from the process Among others the review board that had disqualified Princess Operations had concluded that four of the suppliers Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers Wasteserv Malta Ltd Commissioner of Police and Malta Enterprise were not supplied by the company as it had previously declared But Princess retorted that “while this is technically correct” since those contracts were directly contracted with Christian Borg adding that he is the ultimate sole shareholder of the company Princess also added that it could have provided proof that although the contracts were contracted with Borg the income was applied to the accounts of the company had it been asked for a clarification Bidders had to show they were able to live up to the tender’s obligations by submitting a list of contracts of “a similar nature” – leasing of cars – for the years 2019 2020 and 2021 with a total minimum value of not less than €1000000 Princess appealed the decision in November 2022 but the review board upheld the original decision Among other reasons the board of review said the daily benchmark rate of less than €1211 submitted by Princess Operations was deemed “not realistic” since it would be “financially and operationally” unable to meet the extent of such contractual obligations On Wednesday the Appeals Court presided by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul rejected the company’s appeal and confirmed the review board’s decision Wednesday’s judgement noted that Princess Operation provided the review board with a list of 142 contracts it had been awarded for a total value of €11 million Borg’s companies have held or are holding several contracts with public entities including the Local Enforcement System Agency LESA On Tuesday Newsbook revealed that LESA is still leasing 24 vehicles from Princess Operations Limited with the agency referring this newsroom to a €108405tender awarded on 18 January 2022 to Princess Operations Limited whose director is now Joseph Camenzuli a onetime photographer for the Labour Party and prime minister Joseph Muscat The agency told this newsroom that it was seeking legal advice after it was asked why was it still renting out from Borg or his associated companies Despite having previously suspended the licence for Borg’s Princess Garage last year Transport Malta awarded Princess Operations Ltd a €248000 tender for the lease of 38 low emission motor vehicles one crewcargo van and two selfdrive vans A fellow bidder Davico Ltd had appealed the decision as it raised doubts whether at the price offered the bid could really account for all the real costs associated with full insurance cover It also claimed that Princess Operations Ltd did not have the required number of vehicles listed in the tender But the appeal was rejected by the contracting authority thus confirming the decision to award the tender to Princess Operations Ltd The Court of Appeal also rejected Davico Ltd’s appeal in January 2022 with the Court presided over by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti and composed of judges Giannino Caruana Demajo and Anthony Ellul confirming that the bid put forward by Princess Operations Ltd had been the cheapest Moreover last month the Court of Appeal upheld Transport Malta’s decision to suspend Borg’s car rental company’s licence following numerous customer complaints in which the tribunal ruled that the company’s actions had damaged Malta’s international reputation Last year Borg was charged over a botched kidnapping along with Tyson Grech Luke John Milton Thorne Mangion Burton Azzopardi and Jeremy Borg The men were arrested in January 2022 and charged with the abduction and assault of the man threatening to have his fingers cut off and his sister raped All six are currently out on bail and the case is ongoing Borg despite his young age owns several companies These include No Deposit Cars Malta Ltd Zing Cabs Ltd Zing Rental Ltd Princess Holdings Ltd Princess Operations Ltd and Princess Construction Ltd He was also behind Green Motion and Gold Car Malta and is now operating Sicily by Car franchise through Princess Holdings Moreover Borg’s connections to the Labour Party and his connection to Prime Minister Robert Abela after being involved in a property deal have since been made public

Court provisionally upholds BirdLife’s prohibitory injunction over spring hunting,"April 4, 2023 6:45 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti BirdLife Malta’s request for a prohibitory injunction was provisionally upheld by court in order to prevent government from issuing the legal notice that effectively would open a spring hunting season for the vulnerable turtledove The request that was signed by lawyers Claire Bonello and Martin Farrugia was provisionally upheld by Judge Giovanni Grixti The warrant of prohibitory injunction is very similar to the one filed last year by BirdLife and that was presided by Judge Audrey Demicoli “The main difference is that this time the injunction is being requested to stop the legal notice from being issued whereas that of last year was filed after the legal notice was published In fact this was the main technical argument which the State Advocate had insisted upon and that was accepted by Judge Demicoli leading her to decide the case against BirdLife Malta at that time” BirdLife said It added that another difference is the fact that since the first warrant of prohibitory injunction the Maltese government has received direct communication from the European Commissioner for Environment along with a new infringement process that was initiated by the European Commission against Malta with regards to the spring hunting season for European turtledove These warnings were issued since the vulnerable status of the turtledove does not allow for any derogation from the European Birds Directive to hunt this species in spring BirdLife Malta CEO Mark Sultana said “There is no shadow of doubt that the spring hunting season on Turtledoves in Malta goes against the EU’s Birds Directive The Directive is very clear that hunting in spring is illegal while the fact that the status of the Turtledove is Vulnerable – as declared by the IUCN and accepted by the EU – adds more value to the need for each EU Member State to protect it whilst migrating to its breeding grounds “The European Union’s Directives are the law that each and every Member State needs to enact within their local legislation The local legislation can never in any way go against the European directives mainly because these are overarching above all local legislation including our constitutional laws The local courts are therefore also responsible to safeguard the EU’s directives” The hearing on the prohibitory injunction temporarily accepted today has been appointed for 18 April 2023

New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”

Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Government wants Steward’s appeal heard urgently,"April 4, 2023 3:50 PM",The legal battle between former hospitals concessionaire Steward Health Care and the Maltese government took another twist on Tuesday with government asking court to hear the appeal filed by the company with urgency In a statement government said the appeal to the court’s annulment of the privatisation deal should be heard with urgency “in the national and public interest” In its reply to Steward’s appeal government opposed the request to submit new evidence and documents and in case the Court accepts this request to submit new documents it retained the right to be in a position to respond to them even by submitting a request to present documents that were not available before the judgment was handed down The Maltese Government also opposed Steward’s to refer the case to the European Courts Last month Steward said it will take legal action if government persists with its unlawful actions In a biting statement Steward said it is disappointed that the government is attempting to engage in a legal ‘titfortat’ for purely political ends “rather than acting responsibly and professionally for the benefit of the people of Malta” In a brief reply government said that it would press ahead with its legal position and described Steward’s threat as “out of place” This came after government notified the company that it will be taking over the operation of the Gozo General Hospital the Karin Grech Hospital and the St Luke’s Hospital rejecting the termination conditions which Steward sought to impose when it announced that it would be terminating the agreement last week In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement”
Bernice murder: Accused challenges femicide law,"April 4, 2023 3:39 PM",Lawyers representing Roderick Cassar who stands accused of killing his wife Bernice are questioning the constitutionality of the femicide law Cassar the first man to be accused of the new offence of femicide after shooting his wife dead last year is facing a spate of charges including femicide an aggravated form of the crime of wilful homicide which was introduced into the Criminal Code in 2022 But in an application to the First Hall of the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction which was filed this morning on behalf of Roderick Cassar lawyers Franco Debono Arthur Azzopardi Marion Camilleri and Jacob Magri hold that the legislator “had created a sexist and discriminatory law that gives rise to preferential and differential treatment” which discriminated against men Cassar is charged with murdering his wife Bernice Cilia by shooting her in Corradino The mother of two young children died last November after being shot in the face and chest with a shotgun The accused was arrested at 2am on 23 November by the police’s Special Intervention Unit after a forced entry into his Qrendi house where he had been holed up for 17 hours Pointing out that no other country has introduced a similar legal disposition Cassar’s lawyers asked “why is the murder of a woman committed under one of the circumstances mentioned in Article 211A rendering it wilful femicide is taken to be worse than the murder of a man carried out in identical circumstances” Making the same argument about the harsher punishment the lawyers raised further questions about why only murder and attempted murder were aggravated by the new amendment “By analogy should not every crime committed against a woman be treated as being aggravated Is the life of a man not as precious as that of a woman” The lawyers also queried the amendment’s removal of the mitigation of punishment in murders committed “under the first transport of a sudden passion” if the victim is female – but not if the victim is male “Can’t the murder of a woman also be committed under the immediate influence of a sudden passion” asked the lawyers It was stressed that the protection from discrimination in Maltese law is based on the European Convention on Human Rights and in this case was tied to Cassar’s right to a fair trial Although currently charged with a crime Cassar was still presumed innocent argued the lawyers but with the introduction of the new offence of femicide he was now being expressly precluded from utilising a legal defence that otherwise applied in all other comparable scenarios Cassar’s lawyers asked the court to declare that the legislative framework introduced by Act X of 2022 to be a breach of his fundamental right to a fair trial and protection from discrimination requesting an effective remedy Concerns over the discriminatory nature of the femicide offence were raised by some lawyers at the time of its approval by parliament The judgment will now be left to the constitutional court in what will be a key test of the groundbreaking legislation that was long championed by women’s rights advocates

Tumuluri claims he was warned ‘he’d end up like Daphne’ by Keith Schembri,"May 17, 2023 6:55 PM",Former Vitals Global Healthcare direct Ram Tumuluri agreed to transfer the hospitals concession after receiving “death threats of ending up like Daphne Caruana Galizia” by former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s righthand man Keith Schembri Tumuluri made the claim in an official disclosure to the US authorities which was obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with partners in Malta The Shift and The Times of Malta The shocking claims come as Tumuluri wants whistleblower protection in the US to reveal alleged coercion threats and corrupt practices by disgraced firmer prime minister Joseph Muscat’s government in the hospitals deal According to the reports published on Wednesday evening Tumuluri filed a whistleblower complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act In his complaint Tumuluri alleged that he was repeatedly threatened by Schembri and others that he would meet the same end as journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia if he didn’t sign the hospitals’ concession over to Steward Healthcare The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Tumuluri claimed the threats were made by Schembri thenhealth minister Konrad Mizzi and one of the concession’s original brokers Shaukat Ali among others In March 2015 journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had first reported that the government had struck a deal with Oxley Capital Group of Singapore ahead of the call for proposals for the privatisation of three of Malta’s state hospitals and that representatives of the company – including Ram Tumuluri – had visited Malta two months earlier for meetings The concession agreement covering the running of St Luke’s Karin Grech and Gozo General Hospitals was awarded to VGH in 2015 The deal was later described as “collusion” between the government in the pretender phase The former VGH director also said that Muscat played a role in what Tumuluri claims was a forced handover of the concession to Steward for €1 Both Muscat and Schembri denied the claims Tumuluri also accused Steward Healthcare of engaging in unlawful activity with the government of Malta and insisted he only signed the concession over because he was made to fear for his life by government officials and others working on their behalf The 505page complaint includes an affidavit from Tumuluri and hundreds of pages of supporting documents such as internal emails contracts and project plans In his complaint to US authorities Tumuluri said the threats lasted through the period of the journalist’s assassination in October 2017 until he eventually caved into demands in December 2017 and signed the concession over because he feared his life and that of his family would be in danger if he didn’t According to Tumuluri’s disclosure Schembri warned him that “he is the law in Malta” and that no agreement could protect Tumuluri’s interest Schembri allegedly warned that “if the government could silence a vocal reporter like Ms Caruana Galizia Mr Tumuluri should be very careful not to make enemies with the government” Moreover Tumuluri alleged that during a meeting at Castille Schembri told him “You know what happened with Daphne Caruana Galizia and you don’t want to end up in that position You want us to be a friend not a foe” Tumuluri also disclosed several meetings in which he alleges his life had been threatened and claims he was pulled aside afterwards from one such meeting  by Mizzi who warned him “Don’t force these guys to go to that level”
New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"MUMN issues directives to nurses at health centres, Gozo General Hospital","April 4, 2023 11:33 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti New directives have been issued to nurses at health centres and at the Gozo General Hospital In a statement on Tuesday the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses MUMN said that ten days after it had declared a dispute the health ministry made no extra effort to address the situation and did not send any counter proposals to address the industrial actions The union accused the health ministry of not prioritising patients nurses and midwives saying it is not prepared to address the “humiliating” counter proposals sent ten days ago to their members It noted that no effort had been made to present a sectorial agreement which will address the nurses’ shortage and said the government continued to insist that there was “not enough money” for the nurses and midwives “Instead our “humble” Government is resorting in threatening nurses and midwives who are following MUMN directives Not only that but the Government resorted to outsource surgical operations thus delivering a clear message that it is prepared to spend the taxpayers’ money on private contractors who have close ties to the Government but is not prepared to offer a better financial package to the nurses and midwives” the statement reads The union said such move angered the nurses and midwives even more since it proved that the government was capable of seeking additional funds but then “fails to seek additional funding to our sectoral agreement” MUMN also said it was shocked at the news that taxpayers’ money was being spent on former Labour officials who were given consultancy whilst the union was told there was not enough money to meet its demands “Other health professions such as the Consultants were allotted millions of euro for their sectorial agreement while nurses and midwives who are the only two professions responsible of managing all hospitals which hospitals have an inadequate bed supply for the demands of the population are being repeatedly told that “they have to provide a better service” or ” What is the tax payer going to get in return'” According to the union the last counter proposals made by the health ministry show that the government “has no intention whatsoever to address the nurses’ shortage in Malta by investing in young nurses and midwives but is planning to bring more nurses from India Pakistan or even from Africa through private local contractors” The union said it was also informed that the government on its own accord cancelled operations being carried out on Sundays despite such surgeries not being affected by the directives and involved patients suffering with cancer “This sends a clear message that the Government had no qualms to cancel operations which operations involved oncology patients Not only that but Mater Dei Hospital is ordering nurses to work as porters so to bypass MUMN’ s directive” The union observed that although several nonurgent operations and bloodletting appointments had been cancelled as well as nurses are not washing patients the government has shown that health is not a priority It also referred to Opposition MP Adrian Delia’s speech in parliament during which the former PN leader said prime minister Robert Abela had been aware of the irregularities when the hospitals concession was awarded to Vitals Global Healthcare “This demonstrates that the Prime Minister was not capable to take Steward to court to terminate the contract which caused the Health Sector to be drained from vital financial resources much needed for the care of the patients nurses and midwives” the union said The current directives at Mater Dei Hospital will not be increased the union said Under the new directives nurses at health centres will stop accompanying doctors at health centre clinics stop vaccinations relating to travel and stop clerical work including answering the phone Those at the Gozo hopsital have been ordered not to assist at the dermatology neuro urology DOP SOP paediatrics ophthalmic cardio ENT rheumatology nephrology and respiratory clinics They have also been ordered not to perform any preops excluding confirmed oncology operations and paediatrics operations

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Mandatory union membership is anti-democratic – Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara,"May 15, 2023 8:53 PM",Mandatory trade union membership is a violation of human dignity and democracy Żgħażagħ Ħaddiema Nsara Young Christian Workers’ Movement said on Monday In a statement ŻĦN said that while “unionisation is an empowering and liberating act affirming the dignity of all work and workers” it opposed mandatory membership “First of all ŻĦN regards this as an infringement of the basic democratic right of freedom of association concurring with the Maltese Constitutional Court and European Court of Human Rights” Secondly ŻĦN said it is suspicious of the effectiveness of the proposal which was included in the Labour party’s electoral programme ahead of last year’s victory at the polls “It has been claimed that this “would boost the fight against precarious employment and exploitation” How would obligatory membership in unions that have not uttered but a whisper on the death of Jean Paul Sofia or hundreds of other workers who have lost life or limb on construction sites protect workers from precarity” ŻĦN said ŻĦN also took aim at the leaders of Malta’s biggest unions – the General Workers Union GWU and UĦM – with the movement saying that “we have a situation where the leaders of the two main unions are on the government payroll eroding the faith of honest workers in the impartiality of union structures To propose mandatory membership as a remedy is autocratic and absurd” “It is a mature evaluation of the structure and operation of unions in Malta that is required as well as a hardnosed analysis of the slow erosion of workers’ rights and conditions that is creeping in” ŻĦN added The proposal has also been heavily criticised by business lobbies with the Malta Employers’ Association MEA the Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry and the Malta Chamber of SMEs have urging the Labour administration to withdraw its proposal Last year the business lobbies said that the measure as proposed is “regressive and undemocratic” and will not in any way strengthen the state of industrial relations and social dialogue in Malta Before the March 2022 election prime minister Robert Abela said that although he believed vulnerable workers should be protected he was open to discuss mandatory union membership with business leaders However both main unions support the proposal with GWU general secretary Josef Bugeja urging Abela to introduce mandatory membership in the run up to this year’s May Day Bugeja said this could help fight precarious employment Likewise UĦM boss Josef Vella said that the union has long called for mandatory union membership for low income workers who are often exploited by employers
New Magħtab ‘hill’ a temporary stockpile of material awaiting reuse – WasteServ,"May 17, 2023 7:00 AM",A new ‘hill’ of construction waste that has emerged in the area of the Magħtab landfills recently is merely a temporary stockpile of excavation material that is to be reused by the construction industry WasteServ has confirmed Newsbookcommt sought comments from the national entity responsible for waste collection and management after photographs of the area revealed the existence of what appeared to be two new “hills” at the periphery of the existing landfill giving the impression that the complex of landfills was taking up additional areas A WasteServ spokesperson however assured that this was not the case She clarified that only one of the two mounds of excavation material – waste from the construction industry has long represented the vast majority of the waste that ends up in Malta’s landfills – was actually new Though its appearance may be deceiving one of them is actually the existing Żwejra engineered landfill which opened in 2004 when the original Magħtab dump was closed originally as a stopgap while the larger Għallis engineered landfill started receiving waste The spokesperson explained that its surface had just been recovered to create a more stable platform this obviously made it appear new since the vegetation that had grown on the existing surface had been covered over In fact she added similar work was taking place on one of the sides of the Magħtab landfill which is not visible from the Għargħur vantage point the above photo was taken from “Such landfill stabilisation is important not only to ensure physical stability but also to limit negative environmental impacts and to channel gas to the preexisting hotspots for extraction and energy production” she explained On the other hand the other “hill” is a recent addition and lies outside of the sizeable area managed by WasteServ However the material within comes from an excavation within WasteServ sites While much of Malta’s construction waste over the years has ended up in the landfills managed by WasteServ the entity felt it should do things differently and explicitly prohibited bidders from dumping any excavation material generated The ensuing hill is thus a temporary stockpile which is being managed by the winning bidder in storage which the spokesperson clarified was covered by the relevant permits This material is now waiting to be crushed in various grades so that it may be reused by the construction industry the spokesperson confirmed that some of the material has already started to be reused “Therefore the only new ‘hill’ is a temporary storage of material intended to avoid goodgrade hard rock from being wasted”
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Jesus’ passion is a lesson in humility and patience – Archbishop,"April 2, 2023 1:27 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Archbishop Charles Scicluna urged the faithful to learn from the humility and patience that Jesus had shown in his Passion as he celebrated Palm Sunday Mass at the St John’s CoCathedral in Valletta Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week and accordingly the Gospel reading of the day is an account of Jesus’ Passion the account in the Gospel of Matthew was read out this year In his homily the Archbishop also reflected on the prayer that is prayed on the occasion inspired by the example set by Jesus The gift of humility Archbishop Scicluna said involved the realisation that people had a need for God for a saviour and that “when we decide what progress means without understanding what God wants to tell us we don’t achieve progress but fall into a trap that leads to our own destruction” Humility he emphasised “is not the debasement of one’s dignity but a profound lesson that liberates us in our dependence on God” And Jesus set the example by often choosing to avoid confrontation but not at the expense of denying his own truth including by confirming that he was the son of God even when this meant a death sentence But Jesus also showed patience in the face of his ordeal not least given his betrayal by Judas Iscariot the denial of Peter and the abandonment by his disciples in the hour of need as recounted by the Gospel of Matthew the Archbishop explained He emphasised that in Judas’ betrayal was a reflection of “our own sins and betrayals” The humility and patience of Jesus he added not only provided an example but a way to live “In moments of hardship of humiliation in those moments when we feel like giving up let us remember the humility and patience shown by our Lord” he said “The Church reminds us of the humility and patience of Jesus so that we can deserve to join him in the resurrection to life” the Archbishop added “While we await Easter Sunday in a week’s time with hope let us pray that in these days of Holy Week we will be with Jesus in his humility his patience and his giving”
"To whom is Prime Minister Robert Abela beholden to, Grech asks","April 2, 2023 1:01 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech has accused prime minister Robert Abela of being “weak compromised and controlled” as he criticised him for taking no action against Labour backbencher Rosianne Cutajar after chats exchanged between the latter and murder suspect Yorgen Fenech were published almost two weeks ago Grech hit out at the impunity which criminals enjoy as the government “defends them because it is part of it” while the police and the attorney general are “used” to go after those who call the government out for its actions “All that is currently happening in Malta is because Abela as the prime minister is weak controlled and compromised” Grech said and added “What does she Rosianne Cutajar know about him What do they know about him To whom is he beholden Why doesn’t he muster the strength to remove a person caught redhanded What is he scared of” Grech was referring to what emerged from the WhatsApp exchange between Cutajar and Fenech from messages exchanged between the two during June and September 2019 when Fenech had already been outed as the owner of Dubaibased company 17 Black The chats show Cutajar’s alleged trading in influence as well as it emerges that she received a gift from him of a designer handbag around the time that she defended 17 Black from corruption claims during a Council of Europe sitting “Are you worried that Joseph Muscat Cutajar and Anton Refalo will reveal something about you” Grech asked Addressing Abela directly Grech added “Do you understand that if you remain so weak you do not have the moral authority to decide” During the interview on the PN’s TV station Net Grech also claimed that many of those who contested elections on the Labour Party’s ticket had one aim in mind – that of becoming rich “We know this not only because Cutajar told us so but because journalists have revealed it and that these people went on to benefit from direct orders The NAO reports also show this” Grech said With reference to Cutajar’s message to Fenech about “everyone pigging out” Grech said the MP did not try to stop them from doing so but tried to outcompete them “It is not surprising that they continue to defend each other vote together and that the government had voted down the anticorruption bill presented in parliament by the Opposition” Grech said and added that they were up to their neck together in this “web of pigging out” The Opposition leader observed that “Abela and his friends kept defending each other whilst attacking those who out them and using the institutions in their favour so that they can keep pigging out” He then contrasted this with the Nationalist Party and stressed that the Opposition wants to do things differently and wants to do politics which address the issues that the nation is facing The PN leader also hit out at Abela for using a Labour Party activity to make announcements relating to the government’s work and decried Abela for not using the proper forum to announce an increase in children’s allowance and stipends He accused Abela of announcing the measures to mitigate the decrease in popularity “On one hand we have finance minister Clyde Caruana telling us to tighten our belts and on the other we have Abela who out of the blue announced these measures as his popularity took a hit because of what is currently happening” Grech said The Labour Party has responded to the criticism levelled at Abela’s announcement of increasing stipends and children’s allowance by saying that such statements continue to expose the difference between the two main parties “Strengthening the financial assistance given to people is the main reason why we work towards having a sustainable economic growth” the PL replied in a statement Grech lambasted the announcement as a “cheap tactic” for Abela to save himself and said that taxpayers’ money was being used by the prime minister “for his own gain” The PN leader also spoke about the government’s reluctance to set up a public inquiry into Jean Paul Sofia’s death

PN to hold national protest on Wednesday,"May 16, 2023 6:55 PM",The Nationalist Party will be holding national protest outside parliament on Wednesday following the damning NAO report on the hospitals privatisation deal Speaking in parliament on Tuesday evening PN leader Bernard Grech said the protest is being called as prime minister Robert Abela continues to undermine the country’s institutions The Opposition has held a series of protests after court annulled the deal which it said was fraudulent in February The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In recent days the PN has asked police chief Angelo Gafa to launch a criminal investigation on the individuals involved in the deal including Mizzi and Muscat however the police force has so far failed to react Moreover on Monday Abela chose to respond to the damning report on the Steward Health Care concession before anyone – including journalists and members of the opposition – could actually read it by breaching parliamentary rules Abela’s apparent attempt to control the narrative on the embarrassing report saw him bring it up in parliament during debate on a completely unrelated subject The opposition had earlier rejected a suggestion to hold an urgent debate on Monday afternoon with government rejecting a suggestion to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday Moreover on Tuesday the Labour Party held a press conference in which minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul insisted that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

ADPD calls for party financing rules to be strengthened,"April 1, 2023 6:32 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti ADPD has called for the improvement of the law regulating the financing of political parties In a press conference on Saturday ADPD said it did not make sense that political parties have to regulate themselves due to an Electoral Commission which is composed of parties represented in parliament The party noted that state aid is only limited to parties represented in Parliament and insisted that this should be extended to all registered political parties obtaining at least 1 of the votes cast in General Elections European Parliament Election or Local Council elections “Parties reaching such a threshold should receive an annual state grant on the basis of the number of votes obtained” ADPD said The party also called for the total sum which any one individual can donate to a political party to be revised down from €25000 to €5000 “It is pertinent to note the the law on the financing of political parties has a huge loophole which allows donations used for political purposes to be hidden through the private companies owned by PL and PN “The most obvious examples are TV stations ONE and NET which are PL’s and PN’s main vehicles for political outreach Donations received by ONE and NET are disguised as the purchasing of services from these companies and are not declared as donations in the respective party’s accounts” the party said adding that the current law is bypassed in this way The party’s deputy chairperson Sandra Gauci spoke about the chats between government MP Rosianne Cutajar and murder suspect Yorgen Fenech and said these showed close relationship between businesspersons and politicians “Fenech was not only close to Cutajar but also to Joseph Muscat and Keith Schembri He was also treated favourably by the Planning Authority’s CEO Johann Buttigieg as well as by the Malta Gaming Authority when renewing his Casino licence” Gauci said She added that property tycoon Joseph Portelli had boasted about interacting with politicians on a daily basis “As ADPD – The Green Party we have always made it clear we never asked for and thankfully never were offered any donations by Portelli” Gauci also hit out at economy minister Silvio Schembri who has repeatedly refused to state whether he was paying rent for his constituencies’ offices in Siġġiewi and Luqa “These offices are owned by two property developers – Anton Camilleri and Paul Attard – both of whom sit on the Malta Developers Association’s Executive Committee What is of concern is not just the arrogance being shown by Minister Schembri who is avoiding putting all his cards on the table as accountability demands of him but the pervasiveness of the mentality of impunity and of low standards which is being seen repeatedly on a regular basis” She reiterated that the party has frequently spoke on the need to retain a distance between public figures and businesspersons The politician once more echoed calls by ADPD for fulltime MPs “This would mean that MPs would be able to carry these better and remove or reduce the overdependence of some MPs on the business world Members of Parliament should dedicate themselves exclusively to Parliamentary duties Members of Parliament should not be allowed to carry out any other work while in office This should also include Members of Parliament being precluded from sitting on Authorities’ and Commissions’ boards both in the public and private sector”

"No Deposit Cars targets plaintiffs, lawyer in new ‘intimidating’ video","April 1, 2023 12:34 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Rental car company No Deposit Cars has targeted customers who signed a judicial protest by lawyer Jason Azzopardi in which they asked that the company be investigated for tax evasion and money laundering The video was published – and now deleted – after earlier this week a group of customers asked court to rescind hire purchase contracts between them and the company owned by kidnap suspect Christian Borg The judicial protest signed by lawyers Jason Azzopardi and Kris Busietta claims that a group of 26 customers fell victim to fraud and criminal conspiracy amongst other crimes inviting the police to investigate The protest was filed on Thursday morning against No Deposit Cars its parent company Princess Holdings and Borg who was charged last year alongside five others with kidnapping and threatening a man Borg the main shareholders of the Princess group of companies has since conceded the directorship of his company Princess Operations to Joseph Camenzuli a onetime photographer for the Labour Party and former prime minister Joseph Muscat “The plaintiffs are filing this judicial protest to protect their rights according to the law including their right to demand payment for moral damages and actual damages caused to them the rescission of any contract signed with the customers against the law or which contains illegalunjust clauses as well as to formally notify the Police Commissioner with a ‘notitia criminis’ which is being presented today in order to take criminal steps against the defendants for various crimes which were carried out by them to the detriment of the plaintiffs” No Deposit Cars shared its second AI generated video on its Facebook page claiming it was a “Right of Reply to Honorable Jason Azzopardi” In Malta a Right of Reply is provided by law to give individuals the possibility to correct or clarify information within a publication that has been wrongly reported without having to resort to the courts Furthermore “honorable” is used as a title for Members of Parliament In its first video No Deposit Cars targeted two MaltaToday journalists over an article detailing how customers would be seeking collective action against the company and the alleged kidnapper In the second video the company claimed that Azzopardi is representing the customers “for his own personal interest” The company also published personal details off the judicial protest which although public they are not usually published in this manner on social media It also uploaded photos of some of the customers who signed the judicial protest “These are just some examples of those who signed the protest” the video narration says adding that “while we appreciate everyone’s opinion it does not mean there will be any cancellation of debts owed to the company” The company said it would not be “intimidated by these futile actions and irrelevant claims” as it accused the customers of trying to avoid their dues It also took time to attack Azzopardi by putting up a screenshot of an undated news article showing just the headline “Jason Azzopardi branded ‘false and hypocrite’ over income tax returns The article is from 5 March 2021 and relates to claims made by Clayton Bartolo and Glenn Bedingfield as spokespersons of the Labour Party at the party’s headquarters The claims were made after Azzopardi alleged that permanent public secretary Mario Cutajar had abused his power to intimidate a former highranking inland revenue official in 2013 This elicited a counterattack from the Labour Party of not having filed a tax return for his 2018 which was first published by ONE Azzopardi had clarified then that it was due to personal problems that these were not filed on time The tax commissioner had informed the clerk of the house who in turn informed the Labour Party’s station In their judicial protest the plaintiffs have accused the company of breaching data protection laws by illegally tracking customers The company installed GPS trackers inside cars it sold to its customers on a hire purchase basis The customers are also claiming that Borg participated in a criminal conspiracy and had forced or induced them to pay over €1000 for imaginary contraventions which the hapless customers were told they had incurred – often in just one month The protest also notes that Borg’s fleeced customers are requesting he also be investigated and ultimately charged with having “promoted constituted organised or financed an organisation with a view to commit criminal offences which are punishable by imprisonment for four years or more” Moreover Borg is being accused of defrauding the taxman as receipts for the value of 1c had been issued to customers after payments of several hundred euros Some of the plaintiffs also claimed that they were forced to make monthly payments of hundreds of euros for over three years “for cars which they had never seen much less driven” In comments to this newsroom Azzopardi said “This bullying and intimidation strengthens my resolve to carry on doing my duty to the

“I wouldn’t want to be MP” – Bartolo thanks electorate for “liberating” him,"April 1, 2023 11:59 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Former Labour minister Evarist Bartolo has stated that he would not want to be part of the current government considering the state of the country going on to thank the electorate for “liberating” him during the previous election During an interview on F Living Bartolo opened up about his sentiment towards the current Labour government saying that if he were in Parliament right now he would be very upset with the current state of affairs The former foreign affairs minister complained that the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party have become an electoral machine “becoming alive every five years when the election approaches” instead of alerting the government to fix its problems when things go astray While confirming that he is “still a Labourite” as he still embraces his socialist beliefs he insisted that the country must look ahead and adopt these principles Shifting the conversation to the chats between PL MP Rosianne Cutajar and businessman Yorgen Fenech Bartolo said that while he disagrees with the manner in which the chats were published one must still consider whether they have influenced this public figure’s behaviour “Politicians deserve a private life as long as their private life does not badly influence their work in their public life” he insisted Bartolo went on to mention Konrad Mizzi’s implication in the Panama Papers scandal in 2016 admitting that he did not feel comfortable voting in favour of Mizzi when MP Marlene Farrugia submitted a vote of no confidence in Mizzi Bartolo went on to counter the claims that he only started criticising the government once he failed to be elected to Parliament reminding listeners that he was part of a board that investigated corruption under the Labour government during the 1970s and 1980s Bartolo went on to state that it is a “tragedy” that people do not feel comfortable expressing their concerns with a current MP but feel comfortable doing so with a former one referring to himself “We cannot have a government that appoints people to high positions simply because they have connections rather than because they have the experience and abilities to do so” he insisted Bartolo went on to discuss the financial aspect of politics saying that the country cannot afford a situation where a Member of Parliament earns a much better salary in his private work He insisted that this is a sign that the country should seriously consider the financing of parties Without this future politicians will not be incentivized to enter politics and whoever enters “will be influenced by businesses and the market” he said Asked if he ever predicted that the country would see such substantial economic growth Bartolo said that the “roadmap” of the Labor Government in 2013 was to spur economic growth but that personally he did not predict such a growth which was not very sustainable Regarding the impossibility for Maltese youths to buy property the former Minister said that with the excess of buildings going up one would assume that property prices would drop However this is not the case “Rent subsidies are good but we have to be more creative to solve this problem” he said
"Millions given to Steward as it could have threatened to close down hospitals, MAM chief says","April 1, 2023 10:44 AM",The government kept handing Steward Health Care millions of euros year after year probably because Steward could simply threaten it to close down the hospitals it had been managing according to the president of the Medical Association of Malta Martin Balzan This was stated during the programme Andrew Azzopardi on 103 during which the state of the public health sector and the VitalsSteward hospital privatisation deal were discussed During his explanation Balzan explained the dangers of privatisation saying that the government couldn’t simply fire Steward for its lack of performance of its obligations The private company could simply threaten it to close down the hospitals it managed he explained Such problems with privatisation are also being felt in the UK with a drop in care quality and higher rates of treatable mortality being issues that the country is facing as a result The MAM chief also clarified that the medical association had never agreed with this investment having told the government during the dealings that they respond to the Ministry of Health and not to these private companies Balzan said that he had even spoken to former health minister Konrad Mizzi about Vitals director Ram Tumuluri “Tumuluri has no clue about how a hospital is run” he had warned Mizzi Daphne Caruana Galizia would eventually reveal that Tumuluri was blacklisted in Canada The medical association chief went on to discuss the state of the healthcare sector in the country Mentioning Mater Dei hospital which has recently made headlines for tending to patients in corridors Balzan noted that the hospital was finished in 2007 and in 15 years little investment was made to improve its capacity “Since 2007 life expectancy has increased from 79 to 84 and the population has risen from 350000 to 500000 yet the hospital has not been expanded” he noted Asked whether doctors like him accept these conditions Balzan replied that no doctor wanted to work in such a state and that they did not accept to work in these conditions however they were sensitive to the patients and wanted to take care of them Plans to construct a new building on the site of the helipad have been in the pipeline for six years yet promises have not yet been met he noted Balzan went on to speak about former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s consultancy for Steward Health Care “At minimum there is a conflict of interest and he had to declare it I cannot say anything further since there is no proof” Balzan said He did insist however that it is not ethical to take consultancy fees from someone in dispute with the government “Severance packages are given to former prime ministers so that they remain loyal to the nation and are in no position to share the secrets of the country” he noted
Muscat received payments from Swiss firm that was previously called VGH Europe,"May 17, 2023 10:12 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat received two payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group This has emerged from the corruption probe into Muscat as part of an investigation into potential corruption related to the Vitals Global Healthcare VGH deal The hospitals concession was granted to VGH in 2015 while Muscat was prime minister The concession which was later transferred to Steward Healthcare was annulled by court in February of this year with the damning judgment describing the deal as “fraudulent” Muscat’s income declarations and bank accounts have been analysed by financial investigators in a corruption probe linked to the hospitals’ deal according to documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with their partners in Malta – The Shift and The Times of Malta Investigators are probing whether a potentially bogus consultancy contract was drawn up to justify the €60000 in consultancy payments Muscat received from SpringX Media and Accutor Consulting which used to be called VGH Europe Although Muscat denies any link between the payments and Vitals the company’s name was changed to Accutor Consulting AG in January 2018 just before Steward Healthcare took over the hospitals’ concession from VGH Muscat was paid a total of €60000 to his Bank of Valletta account in 2020 the first payment taking place just two months after he stepped down in January of that year The former prime minister received four monthly payments two from Accutor AG and two from Spring X Media another Swiss firm run by the same owner – Pakistani businessman Wasay Bhatti Spring X Media is registered at the same Swiss address as Accutor AG and the two companies carried out transactions between each other The Accutor AG payments to Muscat were made under the terms of an indefinite consultancy contract drawn up between himself and Spring X Media in February 2020 just one month after he resigned Despite the indefinite nature of the consultancy contract signed when Muscat was still an MP the payments ended abruptly in the summer of 2020 The contract was to earn Muscat €15000 a month for three years for a total of €540000 It was also to be automatically renewed for another three years before it was suddenly stopped after four monthly payments when Accutor went out of business Muscat’s residence was searched by police in January 2022 as a result of an inquiry anticorruption NGO Repubblika requested in 2018 But Muscat denied that the search had anything to do with his Accutor contract or suspicions that it was bogus and merely a vehicle to receive kickbacks from the hospitals’ deal Likewise the reports say that former minister Konrad Mizzi’s home has also been searched as part of the probe and had his smartphone confiscated by police Transactions of Accutor AG the Swiss payroll company that played a key role in funnelling funds from VGHSteward and Bluestone show that the companies sent at least €7 million to Accutor which then directed payments toward VGH directors and behindthescenes investors According to his 2020 tax return Muscat declared an income of almost €482000 from various consultancy work in the year he resigned as prime minister The earnings were covered by a flurry of consultancy contracts Muscat signed in the weeks and months after resigning Following an unprecedented political and institutional crisis Muscat announced his resignation in December 2019 but actually resigned in January 2020 Muscat baulked under the pressure of weeks of protests following the the emergence of alleged links between government officials and the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and the arrest of Yorgen Fenech Fenech is awaiting a trial after being accused of masterminding the murder Moreover his Dubairegistered company 17 Black allegedly intended to funnel money to two Panama companies belonging to then energy minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s right hand man Keith Schembri According to The Times prime minister Robert Abela is wary of the inquiry’s outcome as he is concerned that highprofile arrests and possible prosecutions could throw the Labour Party into disarray Sources said police commissioner Angelo Gafá has resisted carrying out any arrests before the ongoing magisterial inquiry into the deal has been concluded and all the evidence gathered during the fouryear probe handed to the police Moreover the investigations are largely being led by a team of local and foreign experts assembled by inquiring magistrate Gabriella Vella According to the reports Muscat claimed that he had been introduced to Bhatti “years back” by his former chief of staff Keith Schembri and that Bhatti got in touch with him “after I announced my resignation” “Strongly refuting” the allegations about the contract Muscat insisted that he has “carried out legitimate and documented work in connection with my contract” However when asked to provide any such documented evidence Muscat refused saying “It is evidence that shows the projects I have been working on and meetings held “I do not believe I should divulge them beyond making them available to the competent authorities” Nor would Muscat confirm that his contract had been terminated after four payments but he insisted that “everything was carried out accordingly”
Motorcyclists blame poorly designed crash barriers for latest road fatality,"May 15, 2023 1:53 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Many have taken to Facebook to express their anger after Rupert Tabone tragically died on Sunday afternoon blaming the poorly designed crash barriers for the latest fatality Tabone 54 died on Sunday afternoon after he lost control of his motorcycle on Triq Dun Karm in Birkirkara The man was pronounced dead on site Footage from the incident site show that the victim was caught between the crash barriers dividing the two carriageways with eyewitnesses explaining that he was stuck beneath them Several motorcyclists have once again highlighted that such crash barriers are a death trap and responsible for many deaths In the past motorcyclists warned that the crash barrier ends can be “like crashing into the sharp edge of a knife” A 2015 study by the Swedish Motorcyclists Association had found that guardrails with unprotected posts and protruding parts lead to the most serious injuries Smooth barriers without unprotected posts provide less risk of injury According to the Federation of European Motorcyclists Association space underneath the crash barrier beam can also be dangerous Riders sliding on the ground can go underneath the guardrail or hit a post and both can lead to severe injury Crash barriers are specifically designed to minimise car and heavy vehicle damage but are dangerous for motorcycle riders ĦażŻebbuġ councillor Steve Zammit Lupi who is a motorcyclist himself likened the crash barriers to a grater and said they cause serious injuries to the victim
‘The end result of living in a mafia state is death’ – Pia Zammit,"May 16, 2023 7:30 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti “If you refuse to listen to the voices of the living then you will be forced to hear the screams of even more dead” activist Pia Zammit said in a speech at the 67th monthly vigil commemorating Daphne Caruana Galizia Echoing the phrase from antiMafia activists in Italy and elsewhere Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked harassed and vilified before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much” she said “If you truly want justice for her stories then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice To protect them from threats and physical harm What are you waiting for More deaths” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection In her speech Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country and a mafia state” adding that people fall in three camps those who endorse corruption those who turn a blind eye to corruption and those who actually see the full picture “However we’re all experiencing the full picture whether we like it or not” she said as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue  The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law” Zammit said “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women” Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime” He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree” Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice that they are not alone “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat ‘We will get there’ Sa Naslu is true It will happen if we don’t give up It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other” Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly or tells me that I will at least be here to see it the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration
"Repubblika demands arrest of Muscat, Mizzi to prevent them from fleeing","May 16, 2023 3:07 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Repubblika asked the magistrate conducting an inquiry into the hospitals privatisation deal with Vitals Global Healthcare to take note of the damning Auditor General report on the concession and if necessary order the immediate arrest of people who are preparing to abscond In comments to Newsbookcommt Repubblika president Robert Aquilina said “we asked the inquiring magistrate to tale all the necessary action to prevent anyone involved in the ruse from fleeing the country” He added that court must order the arrest of anyone who could be preparing to abscond as he named former disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and former Labour ministers Konrad Mizzi and Chris Cardona The NGO also asked the magistrate to grant immunity to whoever was involved in the deal and is prepared to reveal their accomplices The NAO report published on Monday concluded that former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval It also said that Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract In a press conference outside the Valletta courthouse on Tuesday afternoon Aquilina underlined a number of findings in the NAO report including the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” between Muscat and Mizzi Among others Aquilina said the NAO report found that Muscat and Mizzi’s actions hindered health minister Chris Fearne’s ability to negotiate with Steward Healthcare SHC “The reluctance of the Minister for Tourism to step back from interactions with the SHC was detrimental to the Government’s interests for it created a weakness in its position all to evident to the SHC a weakness that – based on that noted by the Minister for Health – was readily exploited” the NAO said Aquilina also pointed out that Muscat and Mizzi misled the Cabinet of ministers over the agreement that saw government act as guarantor of Steward Healthcare’s loan from Bank of Valletta While noting the “complicity” between former prime minister Joseph Muscat and Mizzi to mislead the Cabinet of ministers Repubblika asked the inquiring magistrate to order the Attorney General to issue an exemption from prosecution under the Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act for persons involved in the deal who are willing to reveal their accomplices Aquilina explained that former VGH director Ram Tumuluri had wanted to spill the beans on the secret deal adding that the report concluded that Tumuluri had been pressured in to transferring his shares to Steward The application filed this morning by lawyer Jason Azzopardi also asked the magistrate to prevent further destruction of the evidence and prevent the suspects from leaving the island with Aquilina saying that Repubblika was informed that preparations to abscond were already underway Describing the concession as an “obscene ruse” Aquilina said the NAO report also highlights the involvement of Muscat’s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi’s then permanent secretary Ronald Mizzi The NAO report Aquilina added states that Muscat and Mizzi’s ploy to mislead the Cabinet of ministers would not have been possible without Ronald Mizzi’s involvement In 2019 Repubblika had filed an application demanding a criminal probe into the VGH deal after the Criminal Court had quashed an order to hold a magisterial inquiry placing disgraced former ministers Konrad Mizzi Edward Scicluna and Chris Cardona under magisterial scrutiny Cardona had signed a memorandum of understanding with VGH in October 2014 months before a request for proposals was even issued for the concession to operate three of Malta’s state hospitals Repubblika had demanded a criminal probe to establish if there was criminal complicity by three ministers in the controversial contract which was then annulled by court in February 2023 In their application the activists had accused the three ministers of facilitating a “coordinated” “act of modernday piracy” “corruption and money laundering among other crimes” which saw VGH’s investor leave a debt of €50 million
Appeals court convicts men who illegally detained journalists at Castille in 2019,"May 16, 2023 10:09 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal of three men who had illegally detained a group of journalists – including two from Newsbookcommt – after a latenight cabinet meeting at the Auberge de Castille in November 2019 while widespread national antigovernment protests were ongoing The group of journalists which included Newsbook’s Monique Agius and Miguela Xuereb had been covering an extraordinary press conference that was called after the lengthy cabinet meeting in which Yorgen Fenech’s request for a presidential pardon had been discussed and rejected After that press conference at around 3am on 29 November three men who refused to identify themselves but who appeared to act as plainclothes security guards kept the journalists from leaving the building The trio were subsequently identified as Jody Pisani Mark Gauci and Emanuel McKay and charged with illegally detaining four journalists – Agius Xuereb Paul Caruana Galizia and Julian Bonnici While more journalists were present – as footage of the incident showed – their version of events was never sought The case did not appear to have been treated with any urgency by the police a police report was filed on 2 December 2019 by Agius and Xuereb with the former presenting footage she filmed on her phone as evidence and charges were issued on 14 July Despite this delay Magistrate Joe Mifsud had found the police investigation to be lacking and in his acquittal of the three men he argued that his hands were tied by the charge – and evidence – presented by the prosecution In his view the evidence was not sufficient to prove the charge to the level required by the court But the Office of the Attorney General ended up filing an appeal in which it insisted that Magistrate Mifsud drew his conclusion on the basis of an erroneous application of the law Lawyer Etienne Savona had highlighted that the defendants were clearly impeding access to the door journalists had used to enter Castille and that such behaviour gave the journalists the impression that a physical confrontation would emerge if they persisted in their attempts to leave the building Ultimately Judge Aaron Bugeja upheld the AG’s appeal overturning the acquittal and finding the three men guilty of carrying out an illegal arrest The judge opted to conditionally discharge the trio for 6 months giving them the standard warning that committing another offence in this period would also see them punished for the illegal arrest they carried out at the Office of the Prime Minister

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Court declares FIAU administrative penalties unconstitutional in landmark judgement,"March 30, 2023 6:13 PM",A Court has declared in a landmark judgement that the administrative penalties imposed by the Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit are unconstitutional and breach one’s fundamental right to be tried by an independent court This judgement is expected to spark a change in the country’s antimoney laundering laws after the court ruled that the current laws and regulations governing the FIAU’s processes breach the right to a fair hearing which are protected by the Constitution of Malta The judgement handed down by Madame Justice Audrey Demicoli on Thursday concerned a case brought by payment processing company Phoenix Payments Ltd which was handed a €435000 fine by the FIAU for allegedly breaching regulations In this case it challenged the financial services watchdog’s power to investigate prosecute and adjudicate all at the same time claiming that this was a breach of the company’s right to a fair hearing The company claimed before the court that it had been denied a fair hearing before an impartial and independent tribunal as guaranteed by the European Convention of Human Rights and the Constitution of Malta Apart from appealing the FIAU’s actual decision ie that it did not breach any regulations the company also argued in court that the parties have no effective remedy to the FIAU’s decisions and administrative penalties Phoenix Payments Ltd was fined by the FIAU for a series of antimoney laundering breaches linked to cryptocurrency The FIAU said that it had found shortcomings in the manner in which the business collected information on the customers’ businesses occupation source of wealth and source of funds – basics in compliance procedures The company took the matter before the First Hall of the Civil Courts in its constitutional jurisdiction arguing the FIAU’s power to investigate and impose exorbitant administrative fines when it was not a court in its classical definition was in breach of the company’s rights to a fair hearing The right to a fair trial includes a guarantee that any action brought before the courts criminal or civil will be held procedurally independent and impartial upholding the minimum guarantees Investigation prosecution and adjudication by the same body would be a breach of the impartiality and independence that is rightfully deserved Madam Justice Demicoli upheld the company’s argument ruling that the FIAU did not classify as a court as prescribed by law and that its power to impose administrative penalties on the basis of an article on the Prevention of Money Laundering Act was unconstitutional and therefore in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights According to this law the FIAU may impose administrative penalties up to €5 million or twice the amount of the benefit derived from the contravention breach or failure to comply where this can be determined or 10 of the total annual turnover according to the latest approved available financial statements Madam Justice Demicoli ruled that this power granted to the FIAU was anticonstitutional and ordered that the judgment be passed on to Parliament to take action on the matter As a remedy the court said it was declaring as null the FIAU’s decision in its regard as well as the administrative penalty it had imposed The judge also ordered that the court fees are paid by the State Advocate noting that the FIAU should not be the one to pay them as it was simply relying on a law that gave it power to impose its penalties Lawyers Kristina Rapa Manche and Edward Fenech Adami appeared for the company while lawyers John Refalo and Ingrid Bianco represented the FIAU Lawyer Fiorella Fenech Vella represented the State Advocate
BirdLife: Malta should not keep challenging EU by allowing turtle-dove hunting in spring,"March 30, 2023 3:36 PM",BirdLife Malta said prime minister Robert Abela must shoulder the responsibility of opening a season on the Vulnerable European turtledove despite the additional infringement proceedings announced by the European Commission against Malta only a few weeks ago on this derogation On Wednesday the advisory body voted in favour of a proposal by the hunting lobby to permit turtledove and quail hunting this spring Yesterday’s ORNIS Committee decision to allow the hunting of turtledoves in spring also disregards the fact that Malta is facing several infringement procedures initiated by the European Commission BirdLife Malta said on Thursday However BirdLife said this disregards the vulnerable status of the turtledove which remains declining “This comes as no surprise since three supposedly independent voters at ORNIS are chosen by Minister Clint Camilleri apart from the Chairman” BirdLife said Addressing a press conference outside the prime minister’s office in Valletta BirdLife Malta CEO Mark Sultana said “Political gain remains the main force of reasoning at the ORNIS Committee where all scientific facts are sidelined This is what makes the Committee inefficient in playing an advisory role instead becoming simply a rubber stamp for Government decisions BirdLife Malta remains active in such a committee only because it remains a platform to declare and minute the facts” He added that Malta’s reputation at EU level has hit rockbottom very similar to the conservation status of the turtledove “It is very sad that our country remains adamant to go contrary to what the rest of Europe is aiming for The turtledove is at the centre of a Europewide conservation effort except in Malta and opening a spring hunting season on this protected bird is not sustainable and goes against this effort With a new directive – the Restore Nature Directive – coming into force this year throughout the EU our country will face serious issues unless the culture that one can take from nature irrespective of its status changes drastically” BirdLife said Abela must now decide whether he wants to continue confronting the European Union’s Environment Directives pointing out that the NGO was the only entity at ORNIS that voted against a proposal to open a spring hunting season for Turtledove “Although hunting federation FKNK tabled a lastminute proposal to also open a trapping season for turtledove – once again disguised as a ‘scientific research’ programme – BirdLife Malta insisted that this proposal should not go for a vote The ORNIS Committee conceded to this request Trapping goes against the European Birds Directive as it is an unsustainable method of killing birds even less sustainable if practiced in spring” Malta is currently facing open infringement proceedings at different levels on all of its derogations which are the trapping of Golden Plover and Song Thrush the trapping of finches and the spring hunting of common Quail and Turtledove BirdLife Malta has also taken the Government to the Maltese Court over the spring Turtledove hunt The excuse brought forward for the trapping of turtledoves is again “for scientific reasons” – an excuse which has not convinced the European Commission in the case of finches for which Malta is expected to be arraigned in front of the European Court of Justice ECJ shortly Unfortunately BirdLife said the ORNIS Committee still voted in favour of a spring hunting season with BirdLife Malta voting against and the Environment  Resources Authority ERA abstaining due to the fact that the Committee was not briefed on the ongoing infringement proceedings “It was only last month 15th February that the European Commission sent an additional Letter of Formal Notice to the Maltese Government in relation to Malta reopening a spring hunting season on Turtledove despite its Vulnerable status The season was reopened last year after the lifting of the moratorium which had been in place since 2017” The rest of the Committee members voted in favour even though information such as last year’s catches for Common Quail were not tabled by the time of the Committee’s meeting According to a Wild Birds Regulation Unit WBRU report a total of 154 Common Quail and 133 Turtledoves were caught during last year’s fivemonth autumn hunting season “However such data may be considered unreliable being based on only 387 hunters out of a total of 9884 licenceholders bothering to report a caught bird Spring hunting legislation mandates that spring hunting quotas depend on the number of birds hunted the previous autumn In view of this the Committee could not recommend the exact bag limits for spring and has left it as a governmental matter” In the coming weeks BirdLife Malta will once again be present in the field on both islands with a particular focus on Gozo with its yearly Spring Watch camp which sees the participation of Maltese and European volunteers aimed at monitoring the migration of birds and the activities of hunting and trapping “We encourage people to contact BirdLife Malta and the police should they witness or suspect any illegalities We also ask for the support and cooperation of the general public in reporting any injured or shot birds found during the spring hunting season a unfortunate yearly occurrence on these islands”
Studies show Bidnija olive trees are at least 400 years old,"March 30, 2023 2:55 PM",A study funded by Heritage Malta has found that trees in an olive grove in Bidnija are at least 400 years old Funds donated to Heritage Malta by The Melita Foundation aided the agency in dating the olive trees in Bidnija with test results showing that the existing trees date back to the 17th century The agency said that the nearby presence of the buried remains of a structure – possibly a rustic villa – from the Roman period where oil used to be produced had led to the assumption that the olive trees date back to Roman times specifically to around 1800 years ago After seeking the services of a laboratory to perform tests on six samples for carbon dating the samples taken from a slice of a dead tree trunk longer than one metre in diameter showed that they at least date back to the 17th century However since the olive tree can regenerate itself the possibility that the trees at the Bidnija grove are older is still not excluded “Therefore the trunk slice is currently being studied by a local expert aided by Heritage Malta’s Diagnostic Science Laboratories in what is known as tree ringing where the age of a trunk is calculated by the number and the distance of the concentric circles observed in the crosssection This process however could be hindered by the very structure of the trunk since olive trunks become gnarled and twisted as they grow” Heritage Malta said Moreover thanks to The Melita Foundation’s financial aid a geophysical study was conducted to obtain more detailed information about the nearby Roman remains and to ascertain more precisely the extent of these archaeological remains Professor Tanya SammutBonnici Chair of The Melita Foundation said “The results emerging from carbon dating of these olive trees are fascinating and provide an important historical link to activity in the area We are honoured to be part of this project” The studies carried out through The Melita Foundation’s funds are part of the Olea Project led by Heritage Malta in collaboration with other entities which have signed two agreements with the agency One of the agreements is with Ambjent Malta and deals with the project’s ecological aspect while the other agreement was signed with the University of Malta and the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage and covers the archaeological aspect

European Commission ‘concerned’ by efficiency of Malta’s justice system,"March 30, 2023 9:02 AM",The European Parliament today discussed the rule of law in Malta with European Commissioner Věra Jourová expressing concern at the efficiency of the Maltese justice system especially in relation to highlevel corruption cases Thursday’s debate which also looked into the rule of law in Spain and Greece came after the European People’s Party EPP moved a motion to debate the latest developments in Malta following the criminal investigation launched against author and journalist Mark Camilleri In her opening remarks commissioner Věra Jourová said while Malta implemented a number of reforms including the judicial appointments “however challenges remain such as the efficiency of justice and the length of proceedings which continued to deteriorate in recent years” Jourová added that several initiates are underway to improve the efficiency of Malta’s justice system but “although Malta took additional measures and increased resources alloced to investigative and prosecution bodies the investigation of highlevel corruption cases remains lengthy” She added that results in terms of final judgements are still lacking and “remain a cause of concern” Dutch MEP Sophia in ‘t Veld who led several delegations to Malta said that rule of law has been rendered into “tribal mudslinging between parties” adding that “rule of law has no political affiliations” On Malta she said that despite several reforms “there has been no change in the political culture Journalists are still under pressure crimes from yers ago still going unpunished justice is still weak and golden passports are still on sale” Touching briefly on the fraudulent hospital privatisation deal which was annulled by court last month the MEP said “corruption is poison and flourishes if the rule of law is weak” Turning to the European Commission in ‘t Veld said “words are cheap” and letters to governments bring no change as she urged the commission to act more strongly to bring real change Maltese MEP David Casa said the rule of law in Malta has long been under threat and “things are going from bad to worse” Accusing the Labour government of capturing state institutions Casa said “those who are meant to serve the people are profiting off them instead” “Profiting even from the sick” Casa said in reference to the annulled hospitals deal which he described as “More than five years ago Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered to be silenced killed to stop her from ousting the present government Five years have lapsed but nobody has been found guilty of the corruption she uncovered The failure to take action including failed prosecutions due to incompetence Casa said derived from “intentional incompetence” In contrast Casa added the police investigations into Camilleri took place at “lightening speed” He added that while the journalist who uncovered bribery and abuse of power was being prosecuted no action is being taken against the corrupt “The people of Malta and Gozo deserve better they are wondering what Europe is doing about this” Casa said as he called on the European Commission to ensure that Maltese institutions protect the people “and not those who betray them to prosecute the corrupt and not those who expose them” Taking the floor Labour MEP Alex Agius Saliba defended the Matese government and accused the EPP of targeting Malta to divert attention from wrongdoings by centreright governments elsewhere An agitated Agius Saliba said Malta is continuously accused with “recycled information and misinformation” adding that today Malta is being “incredulously” attacked once again by “rule of law crusaders” who took issue with the Maltese court’s order to prosecute Camilleri Insisting that court has every right to prosecute Camilleri to protect documents and evidence to ensure that justice is served in the Caruana Galizia murder case Agius Saliba said “those who are supposedly staunch supporters of the separation of powers want us to condemn the Maltese court for having ordered an investigation” Defending the police’s lightening investigation into Camilleri Agius Saliba accused the EPP of “deceit and hypocrisy” adding that it turned the rule of law debate into a farce Last week the Criminal Court ordered the Police Commissioner to press charges against Camilleri over his publication of a trove of messages between former junior minister and current MP Rosianne Cutajar and the man indicted for commissioning the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia Yorgen Fenech The court order cam after the police concluded investigations within 24 hours and court than ordered the police chief to prosecute Camilleri for contempt of court given that the publication of the chats appears to have been carried out in violation of a court order from November 2021 which had banned the publication of any data forming part of the case file against Fenech This contrasts with police’s failure to take any action against the people involved in the alleged trading of influence corruption and undeclared assets exposed by the very same messages If found guilty Camilleri can be jailed for up to one month and fined up to €4000 The Labour Party has reacted to Casa’s remarks in the European Parliament saying that the PN attempted to mar the country’s reputation “by means of its representatives” The PL has frequently accused the PN of making a bad name for the country before the European institutions In its statement the PL said that the PN’s attempts to ruin to give the country a bad name failed as “everyone is recognising our improvements in the fight for the rule of law to prevail” The PL went on to accuse PN MEPs of defending other governments in other countries instead of its own country by “using Malta to deviate the attention from other countries” In the meantime the PN has refuted the PL’s accusations stating that Malta’s reputation has been ruined by the PL particularly by persons like Joseph Muscat Robert Abela Rosianne Cutajar Yorgen Fenech and their accomplices “Instead of being concerned that the party’s MEPs are defending Rosianne Cutajar and the fraudulent hospitals deal the PL decided to focus on what is going on in Greece” the PN said in a statement “While Robert Abela continues to defend Cutajar the Maltese public can choose to rely on the PN which will continue to defend the country’s interests” the party concluded The University students’ body KSU has expressed its concern about the events that have occurred in the country over the past weeks In a statement the students’ body said that while the sense of impunity among the political elite has been a growing concern for years the latest events over the past weeks have greatly concerned it This is particularly the case after the lack of action from the government the Attorney General and the Police force following the Court decision on the fraudulent VitalsSteward deal and more recently the revelations of the relationship between the alleged mastermind of Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination Yorgen Fenech and PL MP Rosianne Cutajar “As the workforce and political class of tomorrow it is a direct concern for university students to see rampant impunity and corruption corrode a sense of good governance and rule of law” KSU said “The message that is being sent is incredibly worrying and as Maltese we expect better We deserve better actions and answers” it concluded

Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Excavation at Mistra Village site begins as court appeal looms,"March 30, 2023 7:00 AM",Days after a court set a 10 May date for an appeal which may yet lead to the revocation of their permit the developers seeking to build a controversial highrise complex on the site of the former Mistra Village complex begun excavating the site to prepare for its construction to the chagrin of residents and objectors to the plans Footage and photographs of these works has been making the rounds on social media with those airing their concerns including Nationalist MP and former St Paul’s Bay mayor Graziella Galea and independent political candidate Arnold Cassola “One cannot but note the speed with which works are taking place in Mistra before the Court can reach its judgment” Galea said decrying the disrespect being shown to residents and to the environment An architect by profession the MP had paid a visit to the site and flagged the absence of a required commencement notice on site among other things these notices list details of all those involved including the developers contractors site technical officers and the health and safety officers The notice was only quietly put up by the following morning Cassola expressed similar concerns but also argued that the ongoing works were an example of how “savage developers destroy our country with the collusion of politicians” He signed off his multiple comments with a “kulħadd jitħanżer” everyone pigs out a notorious quote by MP Rosianne Cutajar in her leaked WhatsApp chats with Yorgen Fenech justifying her pursuit of a wellpaid public sector consultancy Another district MP Ivan Castillo emphasised that a highrise construction on a ridge was completely objectionable not least since the government had pledged to ban such tall buildings as far back as 2014 “When are we going to start to consider the impact on the community of such developments We talk a lot about quality of life… but they seem to be empty words used in empty speeches” he said An outline development application for the project had been submitted as far back as 2004 and an outline permit granted in 2008 That same year a full development application was submitted leading to the granting of a permit in October 2013 This permit had not been short of controversy with the Office of the Ombudsman issuing a damning report in which it insisted that the Planning Authority was wrong to issue an outline permit in 2008 and made things worse when it followed it up with a full development permit five years later However the permit was allowed to expire with the project reported to have faced funding issues But this did not impact on the developers’ plans to renew the application this renewal application was submitted in August 2018 and received the authority’s blessing the following January The Environment and Planning Review Tribunal received two appeals against the latest permit one by the St Paul’s Bay local council and one by a group of local residents though the former fell through on January 2022 because the council failed to send any representatives without a valid reason for consecutive sittings The residents’ efforts – which Galea helped raise funds for – faced no such issues but nevertheless was turned down the following October as the EPRT rejected all their grounds for appeal One of the reasons cited by the EPRT was the fact that the permit was a renewal of an existing one which was seen to represent a vested right enjoyed by the developer Consequently the objectors’ arguments that the project breached policies that were introduced after the original permit was granted were dismissed outright The Office of the Ombudsman’s findings on the original permit were neither directly brought up by the appellants nor by the EPRT But the persons behind the EPRT appeal have since taken up the matter in Court in a case which is being heard by Chief Justice Mark Chetcuti On 15 March 2023 the chief justice deferred the case for sentencing on 10 May Two days earlier however the Building and Construction Authority accepted a declaration of works covering excavations of the majority of the site The commencement notice that has appeared on site declares that works began on December 2022 but that only represents the date in which the declaration was made and not when it was accepted It is far from unprecedented that a Court cancels a permit irrespective of any works that may have taken place by the time the sentence is issued in a notable example on 15 March Chief Justice Chetcuti himself had annulled minister Ian Borg’s permit for a swimming pool taking aim at what he described as the “innovative” interpretations of planning policies used to grant the minister’s permit Whether the Chief Justice will reach a similar conclusion in less than 2 months’ time – and if so on what grounds – remains to be seen but if he does the ongoing works could well be a useless exercise In the meantime the issue also made it to Parliament with Galea asking a number of parliamentary questions that are awaiting a reply and Castillo harshly condemning the proposed project in an adjournment speech on Wednesday evening Once more Castillo emphasised that the project was objectionable in principle and as he did so he recalled criticism made by the renowned architect Richard England back in 2013 when the first permit was approved England had observed that the original complex was a good example of how buildings on a ridge should be built as it blended with its surroundings The proposed high rises however were the exact opposite “You do not put a tall building on the ridge of a hill… it has to be a low building or inserted into the hill but wherever possible highrises should be avoided in

European Parliament to discuss prosecution of Maltese journalist Mark Camilleri,"March 29, 2023 8:46 PM",The European Parliament voted to change the agenda for Thursday’s plenary session to debate the rule of law in Malta The debate will be live streamed on Newsbookcommt on Thursday from 9am This came after the European People’s Party EPP moved a motion to debate the latest developments in Malta following the criminal investigation launched against author and journalist Mark Camilleri Last week the Criminal Court ordered the Police Commissioner to press charges against Camilleri over his publication of a trove of messages between former junior minister and current MP Rosianne Cutajar and the man indicted for commissioning the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia Yorgen Fenech This came after the police concluded investigations within 24 hours and court than ordered the police chief to prosecute Camilleri for contempt of court given that the publication of the chats appears to have been carried out in violation of a court order from November 2021 which had banned the publication of any data forming part of the case file against Fenech If found guilty Camilleri can be jailed for up to one month and fined up to €4000 Follijng the courts order to prosecute Camilleri rule of law organisation Repubblika held a protest in solidarity with the author and journalist In a statement on Wednesday the European Parliament announced that the rule of law in malta will be discussed on Thursday with a vote being taken later next month “A joint debate on Commission statements on Rule of Law in Greece on Rule of Law in Spain and on Rule of Law in Malta is added to the Commission statement on 2022 Rule of Law Report – The Rule of Law situation in the European Union The three statements will be wound up with a resolution to be voted on in April” Last week the cochairs of the European Parliament’s Media Working Group MEPs David Casa and Ramona Strugariu condemned the criminal proceedings against Camilleri “It is unacceptable that an author is prosecuted for publishing evidence that is clearly in the public interest It is all the more unacceptable since it was done in the context of a court case initiated by the MP intended to silence the author when the published documents prove that Camilleri was correct in his statements” Casa and Strugiariu noted how Cutajar used her public office to further the interests of the alleged murderer all the while accepting gifts and funds “Authors and journalists are at their most vulnerable when the wrongdoing they expose remains unpunished It beggars belief how so many years after the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia there have as yet been no convictions over the corruption and money laundering that she was killed to stop her from exposing This inertia in relation to high level corruption when compared to the swift action against Mr Camilleri exposes the fact that Malta’s institutions continue to be fundamentally compromised” While noting that the published documents clearly open Fenech and Cutajar to possible charges of bribery and trading in influence the two MEPs said despite this information being in the possession of Malta’s police and Attorney General for three years no charges have been brought Expressing grave concern the MEPs said “We call on the Maltese authorities to immediately drop the proceedings against Mr Camilleri and take action against all those involved in corruption bribery and trading in influence”
Steward flagged hospital concession irregularities to Abela in 2021 – Delia,"March 29, 2023 8:24 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Steward Health Care Malta had sent prime minister Robert Abela and the State Advocate a letter in which they argued that the award of the hospitals concession to Vitals Global Healthcare had been improper – and confirmed that a criminal investigation was ongoing – back in 2021 Nationalist Party MP Adrian Delia said on Wednesday evening Delia made the revelation in an adjournment speech in Parliament which focused on the concession that was ultimately annulled by a judge who declared it fraudulent last month in a case he had himself filed back in 2018 when he was opposition leader The MP said that the letter by Steward was dated 27 September and had been signed by the company’s president and CEO Armin Ernst who had worked for Steward overseas before jumping ship to Vitals and returning to the company when it acquired the concession He said that it gave clear indications that further investigations into the matter were required and that Steward even confirmed that the police had searched their offices Despite this development Delia observed the PM continued to defend the hospitals concession as he had done previously Abela he said was the person “who had the greatest access to information on this scandal” This meant that he was well aware of the irregularities of this concession “but he kept defending them anyway” Delia observed
Hunters can now shoot turtle doves in spring,"March 29, 2023 8:17 PM",A proposal by the hunting lobby to allow the hunting of turtle doves and quail this spring has been approved by the Ornis Committee on Wednesday The government advisory body has agreed to the opening of a limited spring hunting season hunting organisation FKNK said in a statement The committee will now recommend to the hunting minister to apply derogation from the EU Directive known as the “Birds” to permit turtle dove and quail hunting this spring on the same parameters of the 2022 spring hunting season FKNK said “Basically this means quail hunting from 10 to 30 April 2023 and turtle dove hunting from 17 to 30 April 2023 both days included for both seasons and the times of hunting are from two hours before sunrise to midday of each day of the seasons  The national bag quotas also remain the same as last year’s that is 2400 for quail and 1500 for turtle doves” FKNK said its proposal was presented in a document detailing the “positive results obtained with regards the sustainability of turtle dove hunting which emerged from two surveys and a scientific study that the FKNK carried out with the voluntary help of its members in 2021 and 2022 as well as from the continuous achievements of the FKNK’s Turtle Dove Project ‘Turtle Doves Captivebreeding for Release into the Wild’” Encouraging its members to participate willingly in the study that it intends to organise again during this spring hunting season 2023 once the minister enacts the recommendation of the Ornis Committee FKNK said more details about the study will be given in due course In 2021 government allowed finch trapping under the guise of research which came under harsh criticism from the European Commission and NGOs The “research” of songbirds is generally dismissed as an artifice to justify the trapping of songbirds one which has failed to impress the European Commission which has launched infringement proceedings Moreover no scientific findings resulting from the research have been released to date And while Malta’s government had been allowing a small bag limit of turtledoves in the autumn it has controversially ended a ban on spring hunting for a species deemed vulnerable in Europe due to declining numbers for 6 years before confirming – ahead of the general election – that it would return this year Another proposal of the FKNK was to introduce a program of further research on the turtle dove through the traditional livecapturing trapping of turtle doves but under special and strict conditions in the same turtle dove hunting season where the catch is taken from the 1500 quota and which catch is used to strengthen the genetic diversity in the FKNK Turtle Dove Project however where every licensed trapper would have been given the opportunity to participate at his discretion after a ban of 16 years “Although the Ornis Committee was not against this proposal due to logistical and time constraints the Committee did not see it opportune to make the recommendation of this proposal to the minister at this point in time”
PN calls for AG’s resignation over ‘inaction’ in hospitals fiasco,"March 29, 2023 7:04 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Nationalist Party called for the resignation of Attorney General Victoria Buttigieg over her inaction in the hospitals privatisation case which was rescinded by court last month The court judgment delivered last month by Judge Francesco Depesquale annulled the privatisation deal and outlined a number of failings by State institutions including the Advocate General and the Lands Authority In a clear condemnation of the State authorities’ failure to fulfil their obligations court declared that the Attorney General and other institutions “are under obligation in terms of the law to protect public property and to take the necessary action to ensure that all the contractual obligations are fulfilled and not changed” In a press conference on Wednesday Nationalist MP Karol Aquilina said AG had the duty to safeguard the public interest and should have requested the annulment of the contract itself when it was clear that the concessionaires Vitals Global Healthcare and Steward Healthcare had failed to fulfil their contractual obligations Accusing Buttigieg of abdicating her responsibilities Aquilina said that she still refuses to act more than a month since the landmark court judgment was delivered The MP added that following the court judgement Buttigieg should have taken the necessary legal action to retrieve the €400 million in public funds given to the hospitals concessionaires Aquilina added that he also expects the AG to initiate criminal proceedings against all those who were complicit in “the biggest fraud that ever happened in our country” However so far the AG has failed to take action against Joseph Muscat Konrad Mizzi Keith Schembri Chris Cardona Chris Fearne and Edward Scicluna together with a number of other people who were involved in the fraudulent deal Aquilina said “Buttigieg is clearly showing that she does not have the necessary moral fibre integrity and ability necessary to fulfill the role of Attorney General” Aquilina said
Malta set to get its own Clare’s Law,"March 29, 2023 6:55 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti A bill empowering people to find out whether their romantic partners have a history of domestic violence is soon set to become law with Parliament united in backing a proposed Domestic Violence Prevention Act As home affairs minister Byron Camilleri made clear on Wednesday the bill follows the example set by the UK’s Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme informally and popularly described as Clare’s Law after Clare Wood a 36yearold woman who was murdered in 2009 by an exboyfriend with an extensive history of intimate partner violence However while the UK’s version covers both what can be described as the “right to ask” and the “right to know” – the latter involves empowering police to disclose information to the public on their own initative – the proposed Maltese law only provides for the former an application must always be made by a person fearing a risk of domestic violence The bill specifies that people in an intimate relationship – whether married in a civil union cohabiting or in an informal relationship – who believe that they may be at risk of domestic violence may ask the Victim Support Unit within the Malta Police Force to issue a domestic violence risk warning Applicants would be required to prove the existence of a relationship with the person they are seeking information on including through a meeting with the police The procedure would in any case be confidential – the person of concern would not be informed – though applicants would be informed that it may not be possible to maintain this confidentiality if the police believe that a crime is being committed or has been committed If any conviction relating to domestic violence is found applicants are informed of a potential risk of domestic violence and provided with information related to the support services offered by government and by NGOs After Camilleri’s introduction the Nationalist Party’s equality spokesperson Graziella Attard Previ confirmed that the opposition would back the bill welcoming it as a “small step forward” in the fight against domestic violence But she repeatedly emphasised that it was a small step of a lengthy process that required going beyond the law and implementing many measures in practice The MP also questioned why the authorities appeared to be reactive rather than proactive on issues of domestic violence seemingly acting only after a tragedy unfolds in this case the murder of Bernice Cilia for which her estranged husband Roderick Cassar has been indicted Bernice was killed on 22 November the bill was presented within two weeks of her death on 5 December In an apparent reaction to this however parliamentary secretary Rebecca Buttigieg then pointed out that a Maltese version of Clare’s Law was promised in Labour’s 2022 electoral manifesto PN MP Claudette Buttigieg later echoed Attard Previ’s concerns as she described progress on domestic violence legislation as taking place in fits and starts emphasising that she was not solely referring to the present government as she did so She also called for the publication of the entire inquiry carried out by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia into the murder of Bernice Cilia which found that the state had failed her not least through a lack of resources If this lack of resources went unaddressed Buttigieg argued even this bill would be undermined as an understaffed Victim Support Unit would struggle to deal with its caseload
MFSA probe found Joseph Cuschieri’s Las Vegas trip with Yorgen Fenech in breach of ethics,"March 29, 2023 6:35 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The MFSA published a report which had found that Joseph Cuschieri breached the financial regulator’s ethical guidelines when he went on an allexpenses paid trip to Las Vegas with the man indicted for the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder Yorgen Fenech The eightpage was completed on 23 November 2020 but the financial regulator only published it today “In keeping with the principles of good governance in October 2020 the Malta Financial Services Authority’s Board of Governors had commissioned a review to carry out necessary verifications with regard to possible breach of ethics by former CEO Joseph Cuschieri and General Counsel Dr Edwina Licari” the MFSA said on Wednesday Cuschieri resigned from his post at the financial regulator in November 2020after having been suspended falling the revelations Both Cuschieri and Licari were outed as having benefitted from a luxury all expenses paid holiday in Las Vegas in 2018 The bill was footed by casino owner development mogul and indicted mastermind for the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia Yorgen Fenech Cuschieri was handpicked by former PM Joseph Muscat for the post of CEO of the financial regulator and Licari was handpicked as board member in the FIAU by Cuschieri The MFSA’s former CEO denied having had a conflict of interest insisting he was no longer CEO at the MGA which regulated among others casinos in which Fenech had a direct interest However the board of review led by former Chief Justice and newlyappointed standards commissioner Joseph Azzopardi and lawyer Mark Simiana disagreed with Cuschieri’s claims The MFSA published the report after being ordered to do so by the Information and Data Protection Commissioner IDPC in relation to a Freedom of Information request submitted to the authority which had asked for a copy of the Board of Review’s report In a statement the MFSA said it will not be appealing the IDPC decision and published a redacted version of the report in line with the IDPC’s notice “The MFSA’s Board of Governors discussed the IDPC’s decision and resolved to publish the report without exercising any right of appeal” the authority said In its report the review board said it was “abundantly clear” Cuschieri infringed the MFSA’s guidelines on hospitality and the European Central Bank’s code of conduct when he accepted hospitality which was both expensive and exclusive It added that Fenech’s many interests in companies which although not engaged directly in financial services operate in different areas and it was “very probable that in one way or another the MFSA may have to be engaged with one or more of these companies” “A person of Mr Cuschieri’s undoubted intelligence ought to have realised this… The Board therefore does not agree with Mr Cuschieri that there was no possible conflict of interest in accompanying Mr Fenech and advising him” the report said However the board cleared Cuschieri of any wrongdoing or unethical behaviour on several other issues that were raised at the time including the expression of interest for the relocation of the MFSA offices to a different office block in Mrieħel the number of trips abroad he took as CEO and the recruitment of Licari with the MFSA Before joining the MFSA Licari was the legal counsel of the MGA which as regulator of the gaming sector is charged with monitoring casino operations and issuing licences During her time at the gaming regulator Licari helped Fenech draft a letter to her then boss Joseph Cuschieri setting out the case for extending Fenech’s casino licence At the time of the Las Vegas trip Licari was not yet an employee of the MFSA but was still employed at the MGA Since the review board’s remit was limited to Licari’s actions as an employee of the MFSA the Las Vegas trip fell outside the scope of review
"PN, PL trade insults on bill extending pre-trial arrest","March 29, 2023 6:07 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Once more a bill requiring a constitutional amendment and thus the assent of opposition MPs – a bill extending the maximum term of pretrial arrest for suspects of serious crimes – has led Labour and Nationalist MPs to trade insults and no shortage of political pageantry in Parliament and beyond At present police may detain suspects for up to 48 hours but the bill could see this period extended by a further 84 hours – a maximum of 132 hours or 5 and a half days – when the arrest is related to crimes that carry a maximum jail term exceeding 12 years with the authorisation of a magistrate The PN’s justice spokesperson Karol Aquilina had signalled that the opposition agreed with extending pretrial detention for serious crimes in principle – the party had made such a suggestion in a bill it had presented although limiting the maximum detention to 72 hours But on Monday veteran MPs and former ministers Mario de Marco and Carm Mifsud Bonnici expressed concerns about the proposed bill warning that such a power would be abused and not limited to exceptional cases Both recalled how police in the 1970s and 1980s abused the 48hour pretrial detention period by rearresting suspects as soon as they released them with Mifsud Bonnici stating that he knew of innocent people who ended up making false confessions in the face of this ordeal Mifsud Bonnici also revealed that he had rejected a suggestion to extend pretrial detention when he was the minister responsible for justice and home affairs Justice minister Jonathan Attard had pledged to introduce amendments even as he dismissed calls for more discussion with the Committee for the Consideration of Bills set to discuss the matter on Wednesday afternoon But on Wednesday morning Attard and home affairs Byron Camilleri held a press conference to castigate the opposition after it signalled that it was not ready to back the bill as it stood And the committee meeting which started at 3pm was soon suspended by its chair MP Michael Farrugia after no opposition MPs turned up However the government’s interpretation of the facts – which included suggestions of a divided PN that the Labour Party has proven fond of making – was subsequently challenged in Parliament by opposition MPs starting with opposition whip Robert Cutajar who declared that he wished to make a formal complaint Cutajar said that the two sides had agreed that the scheduled committee meeting would be postponed in the absence of an agreement on the bill only for the meeting to be held anyway He accused the government of exploiting the situation to “twist the facts” Aquilina then noted that Farrugia was all too aware that he was already present in the chamber when the meeting took place but the chair did not bother to let him know Farrugia and Attard both disputed this interpretation leading to shouting and accusations of lying Farrugia insisted that he had email proof while Cutajar insisted that he had a recording of his call to the committee’s clerk to back his own claims The situation took a new twist as Farrugia asked for the protection of the House claiming to have been threatened by Aquilina who purportedly told him repeatedly that he had a score to settle inżommha filkomma and would not forget what happened Aquilina did not contest the wording but denied he was threatening the MP he wanted to make clear that the opposition would not forget such behaviour from the government and would be less willing to play ball “the next time the other side begs for our cooperation” Parliament then proceeded to discussions on another bill amending the Criminal Code giving Aquilina a chance to delve further into the issue – in the face of repeated warnings that he was out of order by Speaker Anġlu Farrugia He insisted that through Attard Malta had a justice minister who “is incompetent and completely compromised… a justice minister who is a puppet in the hands of others” Aquilina maintained that Attard frequently presented bills riddled with grave mistakes before claiming that when he approached the minister on this particular bill Attard himself said he was making a mess qed jgħaffiġha This prompted an angry protest from Attard who insisted that while he took Aquilina’s previous insults in stride he could not accept outright lying “Tell me when I said it” he shouted angrily before calling Aquilina “vavu” and being chastised by the Speaker for the use of unparliamentary language Aquilina then clarified that Attard had told him that the Association of Judges and Magistrates had expressed their concerns about the bill and insisted that he was making a mess but Attard continued to insist that no such exchange of words took place The PN MP then declared that he was ready to repeat his statements under oath only for the Speaker to state that this was not parliamentary procedure Aquilina argued that the “abusive” amendments being proposed by the government would not only breach fundamental rights but were also set to be nullified by the courts – thus rendering any evidence obtained through this extended detention inadmissible He criticised the government’s apparent insistence on rushing through the bill before Easter accusing it of seeking to twist the opposition’s arm through its behaviour and political spin With things seemingly calming down the MP concluded his address with the apparent offer of an olive branch stating that he was ready to discuss a way forward with the minister next week He also suggested that a protocol should be developed so that government and opposition can find a better way of discussing laws that require parliamentary consensus But as Attard rounded of discussion he was in no mood to make peace reiterating his insistence that Aquilina’s assertion was a fantasy He questioned the opposition’s stance on the bill arguing that Aquilina’s opening arguments during the debate suggested general agreement only for subsequent speakers to make their disagreements clear This in his view “made clear that the opposition is shattered” Attard insisted that the government’s goodwill was being made clear by its own amendments to the bill which he maintained were immediately provided to the opposition He also argued that what was actually riddled with errors was the opposition’s own proposal on extending pretrial detention not least since they amended the Constitution but not the Criminal Code and the Code of Police Laws Cutajar invoked a point of order – wrongly in the Speaker’s view – to respond to one of the minister’s various claims of a divided opposition “The minister is attributing fictitious situations” he said “I assure you that we are beyond united on this bill and challenge him to hold a meeting with us next week”
Qala council condemns construction works initiated before appeal decision,"March 29, 2023 4:01 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The Qala local council has strongly condemned works on a large project in Ta Kassja Qala which have initiated before Thursday’s decision on an appeal by the Environment Review Tribunal “It is clear that the works are going on before any decision so that any decision will be rendered meaningless” a council spokesperson said “The Qala Local Council has filed two appeals regarding this site as the developer files applications in a piecemeal fashion to make life more difficult for us The Tribunal did not suspend the works during the appeal Since then nearly two years have passed and the developer has obviously taken advantage of the Tribunal’s decision to start works” While saying that its right to appeal is being rendered ineffective the Qala council said the building is not according to plans and policies and carob trees have been uprooted Moreover balconies will project so far into the street that they will obstruct large vehicles such as waste disposal trucks the council said “The Planning Authority does not answer our queries about the site’s building alignmentThe Tribunal delays its decision The developer makes hay while the sun shines And the locality of Qala suffers”

Occupy Justice demands reopening of Egrant inquiry,"May 17, 2023 9:39 AM",Activists from Occupy Justice staged a protest outside Castille on Tuesday evening calling for the Egrant inquiry to be reopened “The reopening of the Egrant Inquiry is long overdue You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves for ignoring this History will not be kind to you for betraying those you were duty bound to serve and protect  Take action or resign” the activists warned Robert Abela’s administration In September 2021 Magistrate Ian Farrugia called for the reopening of Egrant inquiry  However to date the Attorney General has failed to take any action In spite of recent revelations regarding the Egrant Inquiry and all the dirty manoeuvres by Pilatus Bank officials and employees Occupy Justice said “there hasn’t been so much as a peep of action from the Floriana Police Depot or the Attorney General’s office” The magisterial inquiry into Pilatus Bank ordered that the Egrant inquiry be reopened after finding reasonable suspicion that 11 million were transferred from Azerbaijan to an account at Pilatus Bank through a parallel and secretive accounting system Murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had claimed that Egrant was owned by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s wife Michelle and the company received a payment of US1017 from Leyla Aliyeva daughter of Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev The Muscats vehemently deny these allegations An inquiry ordered by Muscat had found no evidence linking him and his wife to the secret Panama company but the owner remains unknown to this day “Whilst they’re dragging their feet and coming up with excuses to justify their inaction making sure that justice is delayed criminals roam free and are gifted years of a headstart to cover their tracks It seems that our institutions are spinelessly hell bent in protecting fraudsters and corrupt individuals instead of investigating them” Occupy Justice said Reminding finance minister Clyde Caruana that on 1 November 2019 he pledged to make available all necessary resources should there be ‘a request’ to reopen the Egrant Inquiry Occupy Justice said “that request was made by Magistrate Ian Farrugia who called for it to be reopened The Attorney General was legally obliged to comply with Magistrate Farrugia’s order Instead this was ignored – not that we’ve come to expect better from this office” “Well here we are making the request again We’re also demanding that this time round the terms for the Inquiry are not drafted by the prime suspect in the case It is laughable that this happened in the first place” They added that the contempt with which the Labour administration has treated the Maltese people for these past ten years is unprecedented “using its privilege and power to shield those who should have faced justice years ago All this makes us wonder as to who is really pulling the strings”
Standards commissioner asked to investigate officials who ignored NAO queries,"May 16, 2023 9:19 AM",Standards Commissioner Joe Azzopardi has been asked to investigate two public appointees – Malta Enterprise CEO Kurt Farrugia and State Aid Monitoring Board chair Paul Zahra – for their failure to comply with the National Audit Office’s requests for information concerning the hospitals concession managed by Vitals and Steward The NAO’s third report was published on Monday and its damning findings include the conclusion that former minister Konrad Mizzi had misled Cabinet when the concession was transferred from Vitals to Steward and that he had engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter But in his letter to the Office of the Standards Commissioner the independent political candidate Arnold Cassola – whose letters have initiated the lion’s share of the investigations tackled by the office to date – focused on a brief remark in the 450page report “Of concern to the NAO was that Malta Enterprise failed to reply to any of the queries submitted This Office sought information relating to the lease agreement entered into by Government with the QMUL for the Barts Medical School and an account of the payments received by Malta Enterprise in this respect Similarly queries submitted to the SAMB remained unaddressed” Auditor General Charles Deguara said This behaviour was deemed unacceptable by Cassola who accused Farrugia and Zahra of “attempting to sabotage the NAO’s inquiry into the misappropriation of over €400 million in public funds from Vitals and Steward at the expense of the Maltese public and in the complicity of a number of politicians including former minister Konrad Mizzi He described their behaviour as ‘omertà’ insisting that this was not acceptable “in a state that adheres to the democratic values of transparency and truth” Farrugia had been an integral part of former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s secretariat before being appointed as Malta Enterprise CEO in 2019 acting as head of government communication and Muscat’s spokesperson Earlier this year Cassola had asked the SAMB to investigate the concession following last February landmark judgment which cancelled it and deemed it “fraudulent” receiving no reply
"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these

Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced

to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he

Repubblika: ‘PM must take action against Rosianne Cutajar’,"March 28, 2023 2:52 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela cannot stand still in front of Labour MP Rosianne Cutajar’s actions rule of law NGO Repubblika said on Tuesday Last week WhatsApp messages exchanged between Cutajar and the man indicted for the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder Yorgen Fenech were published by author and journalist Mark Camilleri After initially insisting that Cutajar had “paid a heavy political price” by resigning from the Cabinet of ministers in 2020 Abela on Monday acknowledged that some of the details revealed in the chats leaked were new “As I had said everyone has to assume responsibility for their actions” he said “No one is bigger than the party and no one is bigger than the country” Noting that Abela has so far failed to take any action against Cutajar Repubblika said “such a situation is not acceptable in a democratic country where everyone should be held accountable for their actions” Instead Repubblika said the Attorney General and the Police have only taken action against Camilleri for exposing the “dirt” “Given that Cutajar insists that she did no wrongdoing we now expect Abela to declare whether he condones Cutajar’s actions and whether he dissociates himself from such behaviour” Repubblika also called on Abela to ensure that serious investigations are carried out into the details emerging from the messages exchanged between Cutajar and Fenech The chats have raised questions of trading in influence when the MP was publicly dismissing calls to investigate Fenech who had been outed as the owner of Dubaibased company 17 Black in November 2018 The company had been identified in a leaked email as one of two sources of income for the Panama companies Hearnville and Tillgate which were set up by OPM consultants Nexia BT for disgraced former minister Konrad Mizzi and the OPM chief of staff Keith Schembri From the chats it emerges that Cutajar informs Fenech she received a Bulgari bag some time around 18 June 2019 The bag was received through her associate Charles Farrugia better known as itTikka who would not tell her who the sender was However Fenech tells her “I think it’s Mdina house guy” to which she replies “lol so you bought it for me”

Malta Chamber insists political class must address poor standards in public life,"March 28, 2023 1:54 PM",The Malta Chamber of Commerce Enterprise and Industry has made an appeal to Malta’s political class “take note of the serious repercussions of poor standards of governance and unethical behaviour by politicians that are currently coming to the fore” Though it chose not to mention any case by name a reference to the leaked WhatsApp chats involving Rosianne Cutajar and Yorgen Fenech was apparent in its call for action “Persons in public office need to be mindful of the fact that irrespective of their right to a private life when unethical behaviour becomes public knowledge their position in public office becomes untenable” it said “This is why persons in public office should strive to maintain high standards of behaviour in both their public as well as their private life” The chamber said that it was disappointed at the handling of what it described as “the current crisis of standards in public life” insisting that it was allowing Malta “to go through another spiral of reputational damage” “This is extremely unfair on the many politicians and private citizens who abide by high ethical standards and continue to work hard in the best interests of the country Reputational damage hurts international business prospects and the livelihood of many It makes a mockery of the country in international fora and reinforces poor ethical standards among upcoming generations” it said The chamber maintained that the political price of “shenanigans” at the country’s highest institutions was ultimately paid by the country as a whole multiple times over “It is high time the highest authorities of the country step up and clean up for real” it concluded A reaction to the statement was made by Nationalist Party MP Eve Borg Bonello who was first among her party to call for Cutajar to step down after the leaked chats She reaffirmed her insistence that Cutajar must go a position the party has since made its own as it reacted to comments by prime minister Abela suggesting this may have become his preferred option
"‘I left politics poorer than when I started out,’ Keith Schembri insists","March 28, 2023 1:50 PM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Joseph Muscat’s former righthand man Keith Schembri insisted that he left politics poorer than when he started out as he defended his conduct when he appeared before Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday The PAC summoned Schembri as part of its investigation of the controversial Electrogas power station project While a number of witnesses proved reticent particularly those who chose to be flanked by their lawyers in their appearance Schembri – who was himself accompanied by his lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo – proved happy to speak None of the questions asked by committee members were met with a “no comment” even though Schembri repeatedly insisted that he could not remember exact details blaming both the passage of time and the serious health problems he has suffered in recent years for this Among other things Schembri said that he could not actually remember who was responsible for the proposal which brought about the Electrogas deal even though this was the key proposal of the 2013 election campaign for which he was Labour’s campaign manager When confronted with the findings of the Daphne inquiry – which highlighted that Schembri was given a free hand in the Muscat administration because he was deemed a doer and that this style of leadership helped give rise to a clique that “abused their power to enrich themselves at the country’s expense” Schembri protested this conclusion He argued that a police search of his house and scrutiny of his bank accounts and businesses unveiled nothing untoward and that if anyone enriched themselves under a Labour administration he wasn’t on this particular list “I left politics poorer than when I started out” he insisted Schembri had been questioned but not charged over possible trading influence following the arrest of thenTumas Group CEO and Electrogas shareholder Yorgen Fenech over the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia He has however been accused of money laundering fraud and other financial crimes concerning Allied Newspapers’ acquisition of printing machinery for its new press He insisted that it was a mere “coincidence” that his own Panama account and that of Konrad Mizzi were opened on the same day by Nexia BT even as he later acknowledged that Mizzi had sought his advice “because all you touch turn to gold” and that he had recommended Nexia whose owner Brian Tonna long handled his businesses’ accounts Schembri also denied any link between these Panama companies and Fenech’s secret company 17 Black which was named as a source of funds for both companies in leaked emails sent by Nexia BT’s Karl Cini Schembri however admitted to knowing who owned 17 Black long before it became public as he confirmed his plans to enter into business with Fenech after leaving politics He also confirmed that he had informed Muscat thus confirming that the PM chose to keep this information secret for years Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog of today’s Public Accounts Committee whose star guest will be none other than Keith Schembri Schembri entered Parliament a few minutes ago with a number journalists – including Newsbookcommt‘s own Gavin Muscat and Miguela Xuereb – lying in wait He was flanked by his lawyers and he refused to answer any questions put to him by journalists as he entered the building All this of course suggests that anyone expecting Schembri to speak at length on the circumstances involving the Electrogas contract – or to share juicy details on the workings of the Muscat government at the time – is likely to be sorely disappointed On the other hand anyone looking forward to a lot of “no comments” is likely in for a treat today Today’s sitting was scheduled to start at 2pm we’re running a little late which is not particularly unusual And today’s proceedings have officially started with the customary prayers PAC chair Darren Carabott states that the committee received 3 letters since its previous meetingThe first is from Enemalta chairman Ryan Fava dated 20 March A clarification was also made by former commissioner for revenue Marvin Gaerty who was the PAC’s previous witness Gaerty’s successor Joseph Caruana submitted correspondence between which the office had sent in 2014 in connection to the €40 million excise tax exemption granted to Electrogas With the initial business concluded Keith Schembri is now invited to take his seat He does so flanked by his lawyers Edward Gatt and Mark Vassallo Keith Schembri takes his oath in order that the questions can begin Carabott starts by asking Schembri to provide a background by way of introduction Schembri explains that his background is in business and that he had approached Muscat in 2008 and urged him to seek the party leadership and premiership He confirms that he subsequently became Muscat’s campaign manager and chief of staff Carabott now asks Schembri to state his involvement Schembri insisted that his involvement was linked to the implementation of policy the government’s promise to lower energy bills as fulfilled by the contract that would be granted to Electrogas He adds that subsequent matters were the responsbility of the minister assigned leading David Agius to ask whether he was responsible in assigning ministerial portfolios Schembri said that he was one of a group of around 7 who involved themselves in this decision stating that making Konrad Mizzi energy minister was an obvious choice given his involvement in drawing up the proposal Schembri adds that he was one of 5 people drawing up the manifesto Schembri said that the decision to draw up the energy proposal was motivated by surveys that suggested that energy bills were a key concern He doesn’t elaborate when asked to state who suggested the particular proposal When it comes to energy proposals he limits himself to stating that the group drawing them up included Keith Schembri and other energy experts Not all of them are public figures he states without elaborating further He insists that he is not in a position to state who drew up the proposals PN MPs keep pressing him on the issue with Carabott questioning how Schembri cannot remember who drew up the most important proposal of the 2013 campaign Schembri subsequently elaborates that Malta only had two key options – gas or nuclear – and Malta was not inclined to adopt nuclear power “The propsoal was presented to us and I said we can go for this” he says Though he specifically mentions Konrad Mizzi former deputy PM Louis Grech and Mizzi’s friend and consultant David Galea but says that he cannot deem them responsible for the proposal The decision to take up the proposal was collective Schembri insists and he would accept it again given the option Asked by Agius Schembri denies accompanying Muscat on any overseas trips concerning the energy proposal before the 2013 general election Agius mentions a trip to Libya by the two men and former foreign minister Alex Sceberras Trigona but Schembri denied it had any links – adding that they did not even get to meet Muammar Gaddafi who was subsequently killed in the 2011 revolution Keith Schembri insists that he struggles with remembering details not least given the health troubles he has faced over the years He notes that at times he has to write details down to remember them He also observes that he has submitted the testimony he gave to the Daphne inquiry in 2020 to the committee Carabott and Agius ask Schembri a number of questions about a preelection agreement signed between Labour and eliminated power station bidder Energy World questioning whether he saw anything wrong with such agreements Schembri suggests he does not This exchange leads to Labour MPs breaking their silence questioning what the PN MPs were citing and highlighting in apparent defence of the party’s behaviour that the bidder in question was eliminated Such a meeting however would be in breach of public procurement laws which seek to ensure a level playing field for all bidders Asked on his links to Konrad Mizzi Schembri insists that he only came to know the former minister a few months before the 2013 election Recalling that the PN government had fallen in December 2012 he later suggests that he first met Mizzi the previous month The refernece to the collapse of the government leads PN MPs to insist that Schembri stick to the topic drawing an amused reaction by Labour MPs “Isn’t it true that that government fell” Clayton Bartolo asks Asked further on the apparent confidential agreement between Energy World and Labour – which was also flagged in the Auditor General’s report on the Electrogas deal – Schembri argues that one of the reasons he doesn’t remember is that his involvement in politics was parttime his main job was his business Agius – who like most MPs holds a fulltime job – is less than impressed highlighting that Schembri was not the only person dividing his time between politics and his career PN MPs now ask on the energyrelated meetings he attended while in government and Schembri states that he limited his attendance to cabinet meetings where he just “listened” Once more he claims not to remember everything emphasising that things happened 10 years ago Carabott recalls that the evaluation board meetings which recommeneded Electrogas took place in Castille Schembri denies any knowledge of these meetings and denies any involvement in them Agius follows the matterup and Schembri argues that it’s only obvious that he – and OPM – were soon involved of the outcome of this meeting “I’m not entirely sure but I feel that on things like this the prime minister is informed of what is happening” he says Schembri insists that OPM was not involved in the drafting of the energy tender not least since it was a technical matter Though OPM was informed of developments this was only through the routine Cabinet meetings along with all other ministers he says Asked by Carabott Schembri denies having any influence on the decision to grant the contract to Electrogas Carabott now refers to the damning conclusion of the Daphne inquiry which stated that Schembri was being given a free hand because he was deemed to be a doer and that this helped give rise to a clique of people who abused their power to enrich themselves Schembri is asked whether he disputes these findings but he does not do so instead he argues that no one would know more about the workings of the Labour Party than Joseph Muscat Pressed further however he subsequently makes clear that disagrees with the findings Schembri now maintains that scrutiny of his bank accounts and business affairs – as well as a police search of his house – unveiled nothing untoward “I left politics poorer than when I started out” he insists Schembri now questions whether Carabott agrees with the judges’ conclusion in the public inquiry on Daphne’s assassination Schembri now reveals that he knew Nexia BT’s Brian Tonna and Karl Cini for a long time – he first met Tonna when he was 17 years old – because they had long handled his companies’ accounts Asked when he came to know who was behind Electrogas Schembri insists that he only came to know this after they won the power station contract Schembri now states that he was accompanying Muscat for a UN session in 2013 when he was approached by a Siemens representative who insisted that the government should “play fair” on the contract Siemens is one of the members of the Electrogas consortium But pressed further Schembri later clarifies that the approach was actually made by a representative of the German government He insists there is nothing untoward about this Asked whether he knew Electrogas’ owners personally he insists that he came to know them afterwards specifically mentioning Ray Fenech his son Yorgen Mark Gasan and Paul Apap Bologna He then confirms that he had known Yorgen when he was just 9 years old but insisted that he had lost contact with him In reply to a query by Carabott Schembri insists that he was “never” approached by any of Electrogas’ owners prior to the contract of the award Schembri is now asked whether he knows Vitals’ Ram Tumuluri – he states that he may have met him once or twice before  questioning the relevance of this question He similarly asks of Vitals director Mark Pawley and answers that the name rings a bell Carabott cites reports that Fenech was asking the two men to step into the Electrogas contract after lead partner Gasol faced financial troubles But Schembri now says that he met the Fenech family ahead of the 2013 election insisting that it was normal to hold such meetings with businessman in his capacity as campaign manager He suggests that Yorgen’s father and predecessor as Tumas Group CEO the late George Fenech was not convinced about the power station This throwaway comment leads Graham Bencini to question how Schembri could recall George Fenech’s intentions stating that it proved that the power station was discussed with the Tumas Group Schembri insisted that he discussed many things with Fenech including the Arriva public transport contract But once more he claims that he cannot remember the circumstances when asked how that particular conversation came about Pressed to clarify his previous denials that the proposal was discussed with businessmen Schembri now insists that it’s only obvious that the power station would be discussed But he denies anything untoward Carabott insists that Schembri should be consistent as the witness sticks to his guns and insists he held no inappropriate meetings “Do you want me to lie” Schembri asks the PAC chair Carabott asks Schembri other questions about whether he met Electrogas’ ultimate beneficiary owners He excludes ever being approached by Yorgen Fenech on the contract “They were being wellserved by Konrad” kienu moqdijin tajjeb he says of the Tumas Group Both Labour and PN MPs ask him to clarify what he actually means He confirms that any problem they faced would be addressed by Mizzi even if he maintains nothing untoward took place Cabinet was being kept informed and every minister was present he makes clear at a time where Labour strives to distance itself from Mizzi There’s a bit of a pause in procedures as government whip Andy Ellul insists that any documents being cited by fellow PAC members – PN MPs naturally – should be made available to all committee members as was the committee’s practice Ellul’s objection comes as Schembri denies ever discussing a €360 million government guarantee offered to Electrogas with anyone other than Cabinet Carabott cited an email which refers to a meeting with one of the directors Yorgen Fenech which Schembri had been copied in Governmet MP Alex Muscat – who had been deputy chief of staff at OPM and thus a direct subordinate of Schembri – insists that the sitting barely focused on the actual topic the AuditorGeneral’s report on Electrogas Carabott contests this interpretation Schembri reiterates that he had no involvement in the €360 million guarantee Carabott now asks whether he was invited to any party by Electrogas after the contract award “I did not attend” Schembri replies indirectly confirming that the invitation did come he makes this confirmation explicit when pressed further He insists that made a point of not attending such events The mood is momentarily lightened as Schembri asks Bencini whether he would invite him to a party Bencini replies that he likely wouldn’t and Schembri states that he likely wouldn’t go anyway… But he does confirm that he attended a single wedding “U ejja” is his initial reply when asked which one it was He later confirms that it was the wedding of former Pilatus Bank chair Ali Sadr Schembri is now asked about his Panama and New Zealand companies and insists that he only opened them after the trust he opened with Bank of Valletta was “leaked to the Nationalist Party” He adds that he met bank chairman John Cassar White and that  he could not guarantee that such information wouldn’t be leaked from the bank This took place when Joseph Muscat was prime minister and Schembri recalls that he had told Muscat whether he was expected to institute proceedings against BOV – in which the government was the main shareholder No such proceedings were filed though Schembri adds that he understood that steps were taken Schembri insists that it was a coincidence that he and Konrad Mizzi opened their Panama companies at the same time and that the process was handled by Nexia BT since Tonna had long handled his accounts as he previously explained Also coincidentally both Panama companies were linked to New Zealand trusts Agius asks whether Konrad Mizzi sought his advice on opening a Panama company “If anything he came to me” he says Schembri now reiterates that he struggles to remember details not least given his health troubles which he states Agius was well familiar with Agius confirms this to be the case Schembri denies claims that Brian Tonna or Nexia BT ever had an office at the Auberge de Castille “Never… the same as any other audit company” he says Pressed further on the Panama accounts he states that Mizzi came to him “because all you touch turns to gold” and that he recommended Nexia BT because he worked with them “I couldn’t recommend anyone else” In his own testimony to the PAC Brian Tonna had said that he was introduced to Mizzi before the 2013 election by a person he refused to name Schembri insists that he only came to know of Nexia BT’s involvement in the evaluation committee afterwards Carabott asks whether he flagged any conflict of interest Schembri eventually insists there was no conflict of interest In reply to another question by Carabott Schembri denies any links between his Panama company and 17 Black – Yorgen Fenech’s secret Emirati company – and denies that it would be transferring funds to his own company Schembri insists that any links would have happened “after I leave politics” confirming that he was well aware of who owned 17 Black He adds that he wanted to do business with Fenech stating that “everyone wanted to” Glenn Bedingfield loudly protests after questions on whether Schembri used a diplomatic passport insisting that any documentation referred to must be cited according to practice But as Bencini cites a news report he insists that this would be unacceptable because he could not verify the claims made Bencini is unimpressed highlighting that Bedingfield was “objecting more loudly than Keith Schembri’s lawyers” Andy Ellul in a calmer tone insists that the government has no objections to witnesses being asked anything their objections were strictly related to procedures But opposition MPs insist that this is not the case government MPs have objected to witnesses before Schembri denies any knowledge of who owns Egrant the Panamanian company opened together with his own and Mizzi’s He also confirms informing Joseph Muscat on Fenech’s ownership of 17 Black insisting as he did so that this was strictly business There’s a lot more questions yet to be asked in all likelihood But it’s soon 4pm so Parliament’s plenary session is about to start Schembri’s testimony – for today – ends here he’ll be back at a later sitting Of course we have to admit that our expectations of a lot of “no comments” from Schembri have been dashed even if the witness insisted that his memory often failed him But that’s it for today thank you for following our live blog We’ll be back when Keith Schembri returns to the PAC 2pm on April 4
"Ryan Schembri committed fraud on €3.5m debt agreement, civil court finds","March 28, 2023 12:52 PM",A civil court has concluded that former More Supermarkets boss Ryan Schembri had committed fraud when he appeared on a €35 million debt agreement after he was no longer the supermarket chain’s legal representative In his decision on two related civil cases Judge Ian Spiteri Bailey ordered the rescission of the relevant public deed drawn up by a notary and also ordered that a copy of his sentences be forwarded to the Commissioner for Revenue the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit the police commissioner and the president of the Notarial Council The two cases were filed by a number of companies linked to the More Supermarkets group – each supermarket was owned by a separate company – against creditors Edmond Mugliett and Alexander Farrugia Both cases were also instituted against Schembri Adrian Agius “ta’ Maksar” – who stands accused of masterminding the 2015 murder of lawyer Carmel Chircop who was also one of More’s creditors – and Cassar and Schembri Marketing Ltd Schembri a cousin of Keith Schembri had fled Malta in 2014 leaving some €40 million of debts Darren Casha the owner of Medasia restaurant in Sliema had taken over the company in his wake In a December 2014 affidavit Casha had claimed that Schembri and Agius had roped in Mugliett and Farrugia to loan €2 million and €15 million respectively These loans would ostensibly have served to finance the supermarket’s chain expansion into Libya Casha said that he only found out about this debt after Schembri’s disappearance from Malta Schembri was eventually brought back to Malta and charged with money laundering and other crimes he was released on bail last year with a magistrate castigating years of inaction from the police in her decision In an affidavit on March 2015 Agius maintained that he was only involved in the Ħamrun supermarket among other arguments why he should not be deemed responsible While Judge Spiteri Bailey noted that Agius failed to carry out verifications as he should have he could not be held responsible for the fraud not least since he appeared to be its greatest victim the supermarket’s debts led to the forfeiture of his home Schembri the judge concluded had defrauded Agius as well as Mugliett and Farrugia who appear to have entered into the loan agreement because they trusted him Mugliett and the notary Claire Camilleri were both found to have carried out “all the verifications they could have done” to ascertain that Schembri was the legal representative of the companies concerned he was still listed as such in the public register of companies “There were no other verifications they could have made and certainly any thirdparty rights shouldn’t be prejudiced because of internal changes within the companies that was not publicly known” the judge said with the last part emphasised in bold for effect in the sentences On the other hand Schembri knew of these changes all too well and thus fraudulently claimed to act on the companies behalf when the agreements were signed While the judge ordered the rescission of the constitution of debt contracts to be rescinded he rejected the companies’ claim for damages The applicants had argued that they could have prevented the closure of the supermarkets had the debt agreements not led to garnishee orders But this argument was rejected by the judge not least since the available financial statements showing a €17 million loss in 2013 – the only full year of operations – highlighted that the business was far from profitable from the outset The companies – which face a number of civil suits that are pending – “could not expect that the court transfers all their debt troubles on third parties and gives them carte blanche to resume their operations as though nothing happens” he said
FKNK pushes for turtledove spring hunting in spite of EU infringement procedures,"March 28, 2023 10:58 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The European Commission’s insistence that Malta cease the hunting of turtledoves in spring – including its decision to send an additional letter of formal notice to Malta only last month – have not dented the FKNK hunting federation’s calls for another spring hunting season targeting the species It is also suggesting that the trapping of a species deemed to be suffering from declining numbers to be allowed in spring A statement issued by the FKNK suggests that the minister responsible for hunting – Gozo minister Clint Camilleri a registered trapper – is aligned with its interests stating that the two sides “agreed to work towards the best way forward” in the face of the challenges faced by hunters and trappers In its additional letter of formal notice – the first step of its infringement proceedings against a member state – on 15 February the Commission insisted that Malta’s decision to allow the spring hunting of turtledoves in 2022 “fails to comply with the conditions laid down in the Birds Directive and goes against the ongoing conservation efforts of the Member States and the Commission” The FKNK offers an alternative interpretation of the situation providing Camilleri with what it claimed was evidence of “positive results regarding the sustainability of turtledove hunting in Malta” as it proposed yet another season in defiance of the EU This purported evidence includes surveys organised by the FKNK “with the voluntary help of a number of members” during the autumn hunting seasons of 2021 and 2022 and last year’s spring hunting season The federation claimed that its turtledove project – which sees trappers trap breed and release turtledoves with the aim of providing hunters with quarry to shoot – was serving as appropriate compensation for birds being shot down during their spring migration to their breeding grounds It said that its proposals will be presented to the Ornis Committee for its consideration and recommendations The FKNK also provided documents related to the Commission’s infringement procedures and pledged to assist the government in defending its interests

Labour insists NAO report on hospitals concession is good news for Abela,"May 16, 2023 2:52 PM",The Labour Party continued its attempts to describe the National Audit Office’s latest damning report on the hospitals concession as good news on Tuesday through a press conference which saw minister Jonathan Attard and parliamentary secretary Ellul insist that the report completely exculpated prime minister Robert Abela and his government What went unsaid perhaps is that this conclusion is a tacit admission that the same could not be said about Abela’s predecessor Joseph Muscat Though Muscat was not mentioned by the two politicians in their press conference at the Labour HQ – prime minister Abela has long studiously avoided mentioning his predecessor by name and his address to Parliament on Monday was no exception – their defence of the government effectively laid all ills concerning the concession on Muscat’s feet Perhaps tellingly the two participants in Tuesday’s press conference had both been coopted to parliament by Abela and thus had not formed part of the Muscat government that created a hospitals concession that was controversial from the very start The minister directly responsible for the hospitals – health minister and deputy PM Chris Fearne – has yet to make any comments on the latest report Following on Abela’s footsteps Attard and Ellul also made no reference to one of the mostreported findings of the NAO report that former minister Konrad Mizzi misled cabinet on the transfer of the concession from Vitals Global Healthcare to Steward Health Care and that he engineered a controversial €100 million payoff clause in favour of the latter In his own reaction Konrad dismissed the report as “blatantly false” In making the party’s case in favour of its leader Attard quoted a specific section in the NAO’s report in which auditor general Charles Deguara observed that “the change in prime minister marked a departure in the approach that was to be adopted by the government in its negotiations with the SHC Steward Immediately evident was that government considered terminating the contractual arrangements in place” “This was not what the opposition wanted to hear because it deflates every balloon it sought to inflate concerning the prime minister and the government” Attard said describing the opposition’s reaction as dishonest But while Attard quoted the auditor general correctly Deguara’s subsequent remarks clearly qualify a comment which when taken in isolation could suggest that he is speaking highly of the Abela government’s conduct Deguara’s comment came in a section titled “the failed attempts to revitalise the concession” – highlighted that negotiations failed and that according to Steward the government effectively aborted them in August 2021 “After three and a half years the government and the SHC have nothing to show in terms of progress registered with respect to the renegotiation of the concession The impasse that would derail the second and third rounds of negotiations that is the fundamental changes to the nature and scope of the concession that were being sought was such a basic principle underpinning the concession agreements and the Public Procurement Regulations that the NAO fails to comprehend how the parties ignored such limitations more so when these had been flagged at intervals during the negotiation process” he later observed adding that doubts persisted on the “government’s commitment to renegotiate the terms of the concession” Deguara also went on to observe that the government’s decision to set dates for the finalisation of negotiations only to postpone at the last minute “reflected poorly on the government’s management of the process” Attard repeatedly described the Nationalist Party’s reaction as “hysterical” an adjective that Ellul endorsed when he took up the mic whilst suggesting that “confused” was also an apt descriptor of Labour’s political rival The parliamentary secretary referred to the scenes that characterised Parliament on Monday with the opposition refusing a request to hold an urgent debate on Monday as soon as the NAO report is published and the government refusing the counterproposal to hold a debate on Tuesday and Wednesday instead In spite of this Abela went on to react to the report despite repeated pleas by speaker Anġlu Farrugia to stick to the topic at hand derailing the scheduled discussion on the Environment and Resources Authority Ellul acknowledged that the length of the report – the full report exceeds 450 pages and even the abridged version is around 100 pages in length – meant that MPs required time to read the report But he insisted that the government’s offer to suspend the sitting for some time – but not wait for the following day – would suffice Ultimately the parliamentary secretary was highly critical of the PN’s decision to hold a press conference to offer its initial reactions insisting that the opposition wanted to stifle debate In his interpretations of PN MPs’ reactions to Abela’s speech in Parliament Ellul pursued a trope that Labour has long indulged in since Bernard Grech succeeded Adrian Delia as PN leader – that the party is split into two camps with one camp favouring Grech’s predecessor He suggested that Grech was forced to speak after MP Alex Borg – who Ellul argued recognised Delia as the party’s true leader – and Delia himself addressed parliament “The opposition leader – one of them Bernard Grech – wants to lower the level of politics in this country” Ellul said Predictably he went on to suggest that the government would resist this and do the opposite
Abela and Muscat responsible for biggest fraud – PN leader,"May 15, 2023 6:19 PM",Disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat and his successor Robert Abela are responsible for Malta’s biggest ever fraud PN leader Bernard Grech said on Monday Lashing out at government’s refusal to discuss a damning report on the hospitals concession deal by the National Audit Office NAO on Tuesday and Wednesday in parliament Grech said that Abela and his administration do not want the truth to emerge The report shows that former minister Konrad Mizzi had granted authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession from Vitals Global Healthcare VGH to Steward Healthcare before seeking Cabinet’s endorsement According to the NAO report Mizzi also “engineered” the side agreement by which government would be liable to pay Steward Healthcare €100 million if a court annulled the contract “This is a scandal for everyone except for Robert Abela who keeps defending the deal to this day” Grech said in a press conference adding that the prime minister insists on shifting blame on his predecessor despite having served as a legal consultant to the previous administration led by Muscat The PN leader said Abela also lied to the people when claiming that the €450 million include salaries which the NAO repost has proved to be untrue The damning NAO report revealed that the total cost incurred by government with respect to the hospitals concession between June 2016 and end 2021 stood at €456 million “Between 2016 and 2021 the Government paid the Concessionaire a total of €267568404 of which €52687218 were paid to the VGH and €214881187 to the SHC It is pertinent to note that the €267568404 factors in the deduction of salaries of the resources that the Government made available to the Concessionaire Salaries paid during this period accounted for a disbursement of €188510970 Therefore the total cost incurred by the Government with respect to the GGH the KGRH and the SLH between June 2016 till end 2021 was €456079372” the report said Grech added that police chief Angelo Gafà refusal to launch a fullscale investigation into the deal clearly shows that he is doing his utmost not to investigate the fraudulent deal Last week the Nationalist Party asked the police commissioner to investigate a list of 37 individuals and companies directly or indirectly involved in the annulled hospital privatisation deal including Abela Muscat and Mizzi However Grech said that Gafà has so far refused to reply adding that the police chief is part of the secret deal Abela struck with Muscat not to investigate the wrongdoings of the previous Labour administration
Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”
Archbishop Charles Scicluna denies ever being an Opus Dei member,"May 17, 2023 8:00 PM",The Church in Malta has denied allegations made by a blogger that Archbishop Charles Scicluna is a member of Opus Dei “In a recent blog post Simon Mercieca a professor of history at the University of Malta alleged that Archbishop Charles Scicluna is a member of Opus Dei” the Curia said in a statement on Wednesday “This is totally untrue Contrary to the misleading statement made by Prof Mercieca the Archbishop is not and never has been a member of Opus Dei” the statement added
"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
PM seems to change tune on leaked Rosianne Cutajar chats,"March 28, 2023 10:12 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti With the initial attempts to dismiss the leak of chats involving Rosianne Cutajar and Yorgen Fenech as misogynistic and to defend the embattled MP seemingly failing to produce the desired results prime minister Robert Abela is now hinting that the expectation is that she step down Abela had previously said that Cutajar had already paid a political price for what had been revealed – she had been made to step down as parliamentary secretary though soon made chair of a parliamentary committee in an apparent consolation prize But when questioned by journalists from The Times outside the Auberge de Castille on Monday evening the PM acknowledged that some of the details revealed in the chats leaked by Mark Camilleri were new “As I had said everyone has to assume responsibility for their actions” he said “No one is bigger than the party and no one is bigger than the country” Abela said that he had not spoken to Cutajar personally since the leaks took place but insisted that his message did not need to be delivered facetoface The PM reiterated that he still condemned the leak which led a judge to order the police to act against Camilleri who lives abroad The police’s eagerness to pursue this lead has drawn criticism and scorn from Camilleri and NGO Repubblika among others who called out the force’s apparent failure to act in similar fashion against allegations of corruption Meanwhile the force’s deputy commissioner Ramon Mercieca was confirmed to have attended a genderreveal event organised by Cutajar who is pregnant and her partner Daniel Farrugia at the Madliena villa owned by the Farrugia family The event took place last Saturday The Nationalist Party issued a reaction to Abela’s comments highlighting how after days of defending Cutajar he was now “playing with words by claiming that no one is bigger than the country” It said that it considered his statements “as a clear case of too little too late and confirms Robert Abela’s weakness” The party insisted that if Abela truly believed his assertion that no one was bigger than the country he should immediately expel Cutajar from the Labour parliamentary group “If he does not do so then Abela would be confirming that he is being blackmailed and controlled by the clique that has been pigging out for the past 10 years” it said referring to a notorious excerpt of the leaked chats in which Cutajar justified her own pursuit of a wellpaid public consultancy job “This is the same clique that created a culture of impunity in the past 10 years that led to the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia and which is now doing everything to send Mark Camilleri to prison for revealing the truth on the strong ties that exist between Rosianne Cutajar and Yorgen Fenech” the party added
"With Xmas parties banned, Health Ministry hosts €5,700 ‘team-building’ activity","March 28, 2023 8:40 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti While the public service is directed not to use funds for Christmas Parties the Health Ministry spent no less than €5700 for a gathering bringing together “the directors of various entities in the public health services” that took place on 6 January minister Chris Fearne confirmed But in his reply to a series of parliamentary questions by Nationalist Party MP Albert Buttigieg Fearne excused the event as a “team building” activity with the aim of bringing these directors closer together The event took place in a Valletta establishment but Fearne proved reluctant to provide the details sought by Buttigieg including the list of guests and what the €5700 were spent on When asked to provide details of all the orders Fearne simply said that these were done in line with public procurement regulations without mentioning what was actually procured Buttigieg highlighted that money had been spent on food drinks and music in his questions making clear that the teambuilding exercise appeared to have suspiciously taken the form of a party that public funds should not have paid for The MP also asked questions on the event to prime minister Robert Abela who confirmed that the directive on Christmas parties hadn’t been changed However Abela said that the event took place following discussions between the Health Ministry’s permanent secretary and the principal permanent secretary Buttigieg made clear that he was less than impressed by the answers he received in an adjournment speech on Monday evening The speech focused on the cost of living – Buttigieg is the opposition’s spokesperson on the topic – but the MP held up the party as an example of how the government squandered funds whilst failing to utilise them where sorely needed “On one hand the government tells us to tighten our belt – as Dom Mintoff used to say – but on the other hand there are those who gorge themselves and pig out” he said with the “pig out” a clear reference to what MP Rosianne Cutajar was revealed to have said in WhatsApp chats with Yorgen Fenech “The Christmas party – which should not have taken place under present policy – cost no less than €5700 only for the minister to insist that it was a teambuilding exercise” Buttigieg later observed “But who actually believes this”
"Residents, council object as developer seeks to keep SPB street bottleneck","March 28, 2023 7:00 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti The developer behind an apartment block in a St Paul’s Bay street wants to walk back on a commitment to demolish an old structure that narrows a stretch of the street and limits vehicular and pedestrian access drawing objections from residents and the locality’s local council alike in the process This extant structure is over a century old appearing on the 1900 edition of the Ordnance Survey maps It is part of what had once been a rural residence erected long before Sqaq taxXama’ – which as its name suggests was once a culdesac – assumed its present length and became a road linking the St Paul’s Bay primary school to the centre of the locality The building lies on the junction of this street and Triq San Ġwann ilBattista creating a bottleneck in both streets and the approved road alignment for the two streets presumes that the structure will eventually be removed to end the obstruction of vehicle and passenger flows Developer Angelo Spiteri received two permits to build an apartment block on an adjacent site – PA492309 and PA600417 with the latter amending the former – and this process saw the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage confirm that it had no objections to the demolition of the structure which although old was deemed not to have any traditional architectural features worth preserving and not to be of historical importance In fact the permits granted to Spiteri by the Planning Authority explicitly stated that construction on the apartment block could not start until the obstruction is clear and the affected streets are widened in line with the approved alignment But the apartment block has already gone up and while parts of the old structure have been demolished to make way for it the obstruction remains An enforcement action was started against the developer for jumping the gun last year and daily fines are due However Spiteri has now filed a planning control application in a bid to shift the building alignments retaining the older parts of the structure and the bottlenecks on Sqaq taxXama’ and Triq San Ġwann ilBattista whilst demolishing later accretions to it The application would slightly extend the apartment block’s front garden it gives no indication of whether the rural structure would serve any purpose And while the SCH had previously given its blessing to the demolition to Spiteri’s benefit it now “favourably noted” his proposal to modify the street alignment and retain it whilst giving its blessing to the demolition of “an accretion that has no value” But area residents are far from impressed joining forces to object to Spiteri’s plans “to postjustify a breach of the conditions of the approved permits and allowing the developer to keep the structure in the middle of Sqaq taxXama’” The residents also questioned the SCH’s apparent change of heart which saw it again taking a position aligned with Spiteri’s interests finding it “rather suspicious” They observed that the blatant breach of permit conditions did not stop the PA from issuing a number of compliance certificates – which should only be issued after an inspection confirms that permit conditions have been adhered to These certificates should be required before electricity and water meters are installed and they have already been installed onsite as photos show Residents also expressed their fury at the local council’s seeming blessing to Spiteri’s plans after a new pavement started being built around the obstructing structure seemingly in preparation for a shift in road alignments The local council had originally objected to the plans last November highlighting that it unanimously approved a proposal that emphasised that safeguarding cultural heritage should not come at the expense of people’s health and safety By way of a compromise the council raised the possibility of relocating the old structure offering its assistance towards this aim After residents expressed their concerns the council reiterated its objections in a letter sent by its mayor Alfred Grima to the PA “I feel that this application was only filed as a result of a serious lack of enforcement by the Planning Authority through its failure to intervene at an opportune time when it was evident that development was taking place in breach of the permits” Grima wrote “The building in question constitutes a grave danger to hundreds of children of a tender age that walk to the nearby primary school every day” the mayor emphasised

PM has failed to make post-summit ministerial statements since July,"March 27, 2023 6:57 PM",Prime minister Robert Abela has failed to make a statement to Parliament on his participation in European Council meetings and other international summits – a custom long followed by himself and his predecessors – since last July But opposition whip Robert Cutajar was left none the wiser when he raised the matter in Parliament on Monday with parliamentary secretary Andy Ellul simply replying that Abela “always provided the information that was required” Parliament records confirm that Abela’s last ministerial declaration was made on 5 July 2022 and concerned two meetings of the European Council – one which took place on 3031 May and another on 2324 June It remains the only ministerial statement that Abela has done in the present legislature There have since been European Council meetings in October December February and this month – just last week in effect Abela has also attended other international summits including the General Assembly of the United Nations last November but has not made any ministerial statements on these either Ministerial statements notably also give the chance to MPs to ask questions to the minister making them and thus represent the only occasion in which MPs have the opportunity to ask questions to Abela Abela has never personally answered questions during question time parliamentary questions addressed to the Office of the Prime Minister are generally answered by Ellul
Flamingo poacher avoids jail because species is not in danger of extinction,"March 27, 2023 6:42 PM",A poacher who shot down four flamingoes in 2021 has been spared jail by a court of appeal which ruled that the protected bird species is not in danger of extinction In September of last year 24yearold Miguel Zammit from Gżira was jailed for a year and had his hunting licence revoked for life over the shooting and killing of four flamingos the previous year in Qawra However on Monday the appeals court presided by Mr Justice Neville Camilleri said that it was of the understanding that this incident would have had a low impact on the ecological balance in the area noting that a courtappointed expert and the International Union for Conservation of Nature had both listed the migratory birds in the “least concern” category Zammit was arrested close to the site after a birdwatcher had witnessed the massacre and had reported it both to the Malta Police Force and to BirdLife Malta which was able to take footage of the man at sea after he had jumped to retrieve the Flamingo carcasses Investigators had told the court that he insisted he had been aiming at a duck Zammit had filed an appeal against the sentence arguing among other things that there could have been other people in the Qawra However court dismissed Zammit’s plea that there were other people in the area who could have been responsible for shooting down the birds and concluded that the defendant was clearly the one responsible While ruling that it had been confirmed that Zammit had shot and killed the birds court observed that the flamingo was not a species at risk of extinction and therefore the impact of the crime on the species was low The fact that these birds are migratory meant that killing them had a low impact on the ecological balance of the area where the crime took place In view of these considerations the court confirmed the finding of guilt in Zammit’s regard but reduced his sentence to imprisonment for one year suspended for two years The remainder of the punishment imposed by the previous court including Zammit’s lifelong prohibition from holding a hunting licence remain Lawyers Edmund Cuschieri and Alex Miruzzi were counsel to Zammit Reacting to Monday’s judgment BirdLife CEO Mark Sultana said he found the court’s reasons for a more lenient sentence “baffling” “While one can debate if a jail term was just or not… a protected bird is protected irrespective of its status and just because it is not at risk of being extinct does not mean that its protection or the consequences of illegally killing it should be less I fail to see the logic It’s like saying that stealing from a rich person carries a lesser punishment than if you steal from a poor person” Sultana said
‘It is our duty to find the truth’ – Bernard Grech recalls cousin Karin’s murder,"March 27, 2023 5:52 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech urged Malta’s political class to do its utmost to ensure that the truth emerges whenever a national tragedy takes place in an impassioned speech he delivered as Parliament expressed condolences for his uncle former minister Edwin Grech Prof Grech’s 15yearold daughter Karin had been killed by a parcel bomb addressed to her father in the presence of her then 10yearold brother Kevin on 28 December 1977 Her father was then in charge of the obstetrics and gynaecology department of St Luke’s Hospital having just returned to Malta at the height of a doctor’s strike despite this potential lead however the murder remains unsolved to this day Bernard Grech was just 6 years old when his cousin was killed and told Parliament that had only met her for the first time at a family Christmas gathering just days earlier Karin had been a boarder at a UK school He teared up as he recounted how his older brother – then aged 17 – recounted going to their uncle’s home and seeing their dying cousin being cradled in her father’s arms and said that the tragedy left a deep impact on the whole family and not just Karin’s brother and parents “I don’t wish to speak on behalf of all of us but it was a moment in which many of us lost faith in politics as a whole” he said “In which many of us felt betrayed by the state” He spoke of numerous occasions where his uncle – who he described as his hero who literally saved his life when he was born – would recount that the authorities were taking him for a ride “because he felt that there were those who were doing everything to prevent the truth from coming out” And he said that it was a moment that marked him and that despite his young age he started paying more attention to what was happening around him “As I grew up I remember the anger I felt about the cousin that I never got to love never got to know because her life was taken from her at 15 by someone who felt entitled to violence” he said And he added that his uncle never truly recovered from the loss of his beloved daughter not least because he felt guilt as though her death was that a result of his “noble gesture” “We were all proud of what he had done and it was clearly not his fault it was the fault of the criminal cowards behind this act” he said “And if you are still listening” he added addressing whoever they may be “you should be ashamed of yourselves” Grech said that his uncle spent 45 years seeking the truth and even his foray into politics – he was an MP between 1992 and 1998 serving as social security minister in the Alfred Sant government between 1996 and 1998 – was motivated by this quest But even this failed to produce any developments and Grech said that his uncle spent the rest of his life feeling regret and a sense of betrayal The one silver lining Grech said was the civil court case which awarded his uncle’s family compensation and confirmed that his cousin’s murder was politicallymotivated “I hope that he knows the truth now” Grech mused The opposition leader insisted that the ordeal his family had gone through should serve as a warning to politicians whenever they seek to conceal the truth “Behind this hidden truth is a pain that people never recover from there are people entire families that remain hurt that still don’t find peace” he said Grech added that he felt that politicians had a duty to act to ensure that the truth emerges and justice is served whenever a national tragedy takes place “The law must be applied equally to all” he insisted “Whilst thanking Parliament for their expression of condolences also on behalf of my aunt Pearl and my cousin Kevin… I ask it to ensure that the death of my cousin Karin Grech is not in vain that the sense of regret my uncle felt was not in vain”

Konrad Mizzi misled Cabinet over hospitals concession deal – NAO,"May 15, 2023 5:41 PM",Former minister Konrad Mizzi granted Vitals Global Healthcare VGH authorisation to transfer the hospitals concession to Steward Healthcare SHC before seeking Cabinet’s approval a damning NAO audit shows The new audit report states that Mizzi acted in “haste” and the transfer was authorised “unilaterally” without “the appropriate sanction” by the Cabinet of ministers The requests by VGH were only discussed in Cabinet on 9 January 2018 “days after the approvals” by the then tourism minister had already been granted the report says After racking up €36 million in debts VGH then agreed to transfer the contract to Steward Healthcare for a reported €1 The report also belies disgraced former prime minister Joseph Muscat’s claims that all decisions taken on the hospitals deal were taken by his Cabinet of ministers Speaking in the aftermath of the court judgment that annulled the concession agreement in February Muscat had claimed that all stages leading up to the concession of the hospitals were transparent and legal as they were taken after continuous discussions and collective decisions by the Cabinet Mizzi is also accused of having misled the Cabinet of ministers on the side agreement he concluded with Steward by which government would be liable to pay the company €100 million if a court annulled the contract The report says that Mizzi “engineered” the side deal through his misleading of cabinet The report adds that the “unorthodox dynamic that persisted” Mizzi and Muscat to the detriment current health minister Chris Fearne “remained a matter of grave concern to the NAO” “The delegation of responsibility for a health concession to the Minister for Tourism was deemed illogical by the NAO and provided a convenient opportunity for the exploitation of Government creating weakness where there ought to have been none a weakness all to readily leveraged by the SHC” “The most evident exploitation was that secured by the SHC in terms of Government’s liability to pay €100000000 and the sum of the lenders’ debt to the Concessionaire in case of courtdeclared nullity of the concession agreements irrespective of the party attributed the default a situation precipitated by the Minister for Tourism and engineered through his misleading of Cabinet Compounding matters was that Cabinet’s authorisation was not sought by the Minister for Tourism in instances when Government acted as guarantor in several financing agreements entered into by the SHC and the BOV” In February Judge Francesco Depasquale ordered that the three hospitals – the Gozo General Hospital Karin Grech Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital – be returned to the government within three months This came after former PN leader Adrian Delia opened a court case in 2018 in a bid to force the cancellation of the 99year emphyteutical concession agreement on the basis that the original concessionaire VGH and their heirs in title Steward Healthcare had not fulfilled their contractual obligations Depasquale had harsh words for all parties involved in the deal including government concessionaires VGH and Steward Healthcare and in a scathing sentence said government had failed to protect the national interest in the privatisation deal In a damning verdict of the backroom deals that among others saw government agree to a €100 million payoff piloted by Mizzi the judge said “the government of Malta instead of defending the interests of the Maltese people… incredibly accepted a change to the agreement” Defying all logic the judge said Mizzi granted VGH another three years automatically extendable for another year and a half that is four and a half years in total ie until the end of the year 2022 to do what they had failed to do by September 2018 The judge also pointed out that Mizzi refused to testify and give an explanation after he had resigned from the Cabinet of Ministers on 26 November 2019 Highlighting the testimony given by current health minister Chris Fearne court said Mizzi’s resignation came on the very same day Cabinet was discussing an official complaint by Fearne who held that Mizzi had taken decisions and entered into agreements behind his back The latest report was tabled in parliament on Monday afternoon Government Whip Andy Ellul requested that parliament holds an urgent debate on the report published by the NAO But the Opposition disagreed suggesting instead holding the debate over two special sessions on Tuesday Opposition Whip Robert Cutajar said if the government was serious about having a proper discussion MPs should be given time to digest the NAO’s findings Moreover the National Audit Office expressed great concern that Mizzi refused to collaborate during the probe “It is with the gravest concern that the NAO views the failure of the Minister for Tourism to cooperate in this audit as inexcusable compounded no less by the centrality of his role in the concession The shirking of accountability on the part of the Minister for Tourism hampered this Office in its understanding of the initial developments that led to the concession being taken over by the SHC and impacted other aspects for which he assumed responsibility in relation thereto most notably in authorising the change of control and in representing Government as guarantor for funds secured by the SHC” In addition the NAO said it could not verify assertions made by others regarding the role played by Mizzi in this concession “The NAO holds a bleak view of the Minister for Tourism’s conduct in this respect for ministers of Government and public officials who have acted in the interests of the Government should find no difficulty in accounting for their decisions and actions The action on the part of the Minister for Tourism in not cooperating with the NAO was deemed deplorable”

Grech: ‘The thieves are turning against each other’,"May 18, 2023 8:54 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti PN leader Bernard Grech called his supporters on Wednesday as he said that the latest revelations on the fraudulent hospitals deal piloted by former prime minister Joseph Muscat showed that the corrupt are turning against each other Those who thought they were above the law Grech said in reference to Muscat and his former righthand men Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi “are hiding and blaming each other” Addressing a protest outside parliament on Wednesday evening Grech said “they are now turning against each other as thieves do” He added that the people “have a mission to give birth to a new Malta a clean Malta where our children can have the future they deserve” Grech recalled that slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia had exposed the deceit and corruption in the hospitals deal and said that “we can never stop honouring her” “She gave her life so we can know the truth we know today” Grech told protestors “We must never forget her” He also pointed out that a number of Maltese and foreign journalists are striving to uncover the truth about the “corrupt Labour government” “Journalists civil society Adrian Delia Simon Busuttil – these people have all contributed to ensure Daphne did not die in vain” he said The PN leader also saluted activists and civil society organisations that have for years strived to for justice and kept up the fight against corruption as he singled out Repubblika and Occupy Justice for their invaluable work Grech added that everyone who worked for the truth is either getting killed threatened or ridiculed The protest came after a a damning NAO report found that Mizzi and Muscat conspired to mislead the Cabinet of minister over various aspects of the concession deal which was annulled by court in February 2023 This was followed by revelations that Muscat received payments from a Swiss firm that was previously named VGH Europe and which is suspected of funnelling public funds back to the investors behind the Vitals Global Health Care Group VGH “This shows that we are living in a mafia state where people are killed people are threatened and where people’s money is stolen to be given to criminals” the PN leader said “We are living in surreal times It is now the moment of truth the moment when we tell them that enough is enough” Grech told the crowd People have had enough of  the “corrupt government” Grech said as he urged people of all political hues to remain united to create a better future for the country “and ensure impunity does not reign” While insisting that the PN will not shy away from fighting corruption Grech said “we are not done we still have work to do and we must do this together We cannot continue to let them do as they please”

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
"El Hiblu 3: Used as pawns in a fight which isn’t their own, activists call for charges to be dropped","March 27, 2023 3:36 PM",The three young men facing criminal charges in the El Hiblu case are being used as “pawns” in a fight which is not their own lecturer and activist Dr Maria Pisani told those gathered on Monday Addressing a press conference in which activists urged the authorities to drop the charges against the three young men accused of terrorism in the El Hiblu case Pisani reminded that the accused arrived in Malta as teenagers Since then four years have passed and the court case has not been closed yet “We are here today to speak about three young men teenagers when they arrived in Malta Amara Khader Abdallah Three young men whose lives was being tangled This is about the lives and hopes of three young men But is also about the toxicity of the political sphere” she said and added “their lives used as pawns in a fight which isn’t their own” The authorities act as a terrorising force that put the lives of the three young men on hold Pisani charged and observed that they had been thrown into prison for resisting an illegal return to war zone “Seven months in prison violating their rights Violating them in their very being And still today while being outside they are still waiting minute by minute hour by hour year by year They cannot be thinking about their future They cannot hope for a future because we are taking their future away from them” she said “If power wants to act it can act And it can act quickly” Pisani said as she called on the attorney general as well as the public to be their voice and ask for justice David Yambio founder of Refugees in Libya said that the activists are demanding justice “We have come today to ask for justice human rights and protection to those of us who have been denied these” he said A refugee himself Yambio explained how migrants and refugees come from countries ravaged by war authoritarianism tyrannical dictatorship and reduced to poverty as a result “Once we flee we are degraded and dehumanized our dignity undermined by local and international laws” he said He highlighted how people who flee their home countries suffer rape and torture in Libya and once they make it out alive they would sometimes be sent back to Libya through socalled pushbacks “We have come here today because we still believe there’s a space left for the Maltese authorities to do the just thing that the Maltese people demand and that which we demand to drop all the charges against these three men who had to fight the injustice and poverty at the time of birth to this day” he said Author lecturer and PEN Malta president Immanuel Mifsud reflected on the situation of the three young men in a message sent to the organisers “This story teaches me that absurdity is not a theme in some novel or play some people live it every day that passes” he said The message was read by lecturer and anthropologist Dr Daniela DeBono “What does the story of the El Hiblu 3 teach me as someone who can take a swim when I please travel when I feel like it spend a whole day in bed without leaving the house if that’s what I wish to do” he asked “The very first thing it teaches me is that if you’re saved and you save others from drowning then you risk being thrown in jail Even if you defend yourself you risk being thrown in jail “Secondly it teaches me that the highest institutions of a democratic country that professes legality and the rule of law may on account of a logic to their practice that no one understands leave you hanging on for a year for two years and longer” Dr Mifsud said Professor Daniela DeBono outlined the El Hiblu case at the beginning of the press conference “Abdalla Amara and Kader along with dozens of other people four years ago found themselves in an extremely difficult situation and at risk of dying in the Mediterranean Sea After being rescued from drowning by the tanker El Hiblu the captain of the ship started sailing in the direction of Libya – the same place from where they had fled due to turmoil and violence that they faced The ship was full of people who had just been rescued “When they realised that they were headed to Libya they were scared and desperate There was crying shouting and some indicated that they were ready to jump into the rough sea to certain death to escape the hell that is in Libya The captain and the rest of the crew could not communicate because they did not speak common languages” The three youths acted as translators and mediators between the group that had just been rescued the captain and the crew “It was thanks to them that the situation calmed down and no one jumped into the sea” she said and underlined that the trio are still proud of their action to this day “they saved people” “They helped to prevent a return to Libya and therefore saved many from being thrown into hell again in defiance of international law We really believe they have done something noble They didn’t fight they didn’t hurt anyone They did one thing they spoke translated and mediated” she explained Eventually the ship was brought to Malta and the three were arrested and charged with seizing a ship and committing acts of terrorism “And if this is not enough the process in the court of compilation has now been going on for four years Four years Four years of agony being accused unpleasantly four years in limbo four years with their lives suspended” she said and made reference to an article penned by the former dean of the Faculty of the Laws Professor Kevin Aquilina President emeritus MarieLouise Coleiro Preca also addressed the press conference and called on the Attorney General to drop the charges “We are still

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed

‘Kulħadd jitħanżer’ but government wants people to tighten their belts – Grech,"March 26, 2023 1:25 PM",The government is telling people to tighten their belts whilst it continues to dish out direct orders to friends Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech said on Sunday as he gave a few examples on how the government could cut its costs if it was to stop “pigging out” Addressing a party activity on Gozo Grech referred to a statement by finance minister Clyde Caruana who said that “we need to tighten our belt” Grech observed that “his friends’ belts could be tightened” for starters and explained that this could be done by not putting people close to the Labour Party in posts where they earn salaries amounting to €80000 and employing persons of trust to do nothing “You should serve the nation You shouldn’t be ransacking the country” Grech said The Opposition leader observed that it was unsurprising that Labourites have approached the PN telling them “they’ve had enough” and said that more people are approaching the party to become members Addressing the Labourites Nationalists and those who do not belong to a political party Grech said “Let’s work for a truly Malta tagħna lkoll literally Malta belongs to all of us and not cosa nostra literally Our thing but also be a reference to mafia of the Labour Party” Grech then spoke about how Malta needs to return to normality where justice is served where people are not subject to precarious work and where people are free of oppression “Our hearts go out for the vulnerable for the lonely and for those who feel like giving up on the system” Grech said He also spoke about the Gozo General Hospital the only hospital on the sister island and said the only thing the Labourled administration did was to handed it over to those who have “stolen” over €400 million and did not invest a single €1 Gozitans have complained that simple medical treatment are no longer offered in Gozo Grech said and added that on a number of occasions Gozitans had to come to Malta for lifesaving treatment “It’s not a joke that a person who has a medical condition for example a cardiac issue has to live in fear that when he would require lifesaving treatment its not there” Grech underlined “That’s when you realise that the government’s health care plan for the past ten years has been a soulless ruse” The Nationalist leader said people are being left without a choice and have to undergo surgeries at a private hospital or clinic sometimes spending thousands of euros “It’s all well and good when someone affords it even though they have a right to free medical healthcare but what happens to those who cannot afford it What should they do” he asked Grech accused the Labourled government of destroying the healthcare system with people having to beg for the services they are entitled to He referred to his speech when he invited prime minister Robert Abela to institute legal proceedings against Steward Healthcare to recover the taxpayers’ money given to the concessionaire which did not translate into any investment and said that instead Abela embarked on a campaign to try and convince everyone that less money has been spent “You’re being publicly denounced for losing your socialist soul you’ve destroyed the Labour Party and you are not a Labourite” Grech said He accused Abela of doing what it takes to remain in power and of defending “each and every corrupt contract signed in the past ten years”
PM avoids uncomfortable topics as Labour marks election anniversary,"March 26, 2023 12:00 PM",The first anniversary of the 2022 election arrives at a time of controversy and embarrassment for the Labour Party but one wouldn’t guess it if one followed prime minister Robert Abela’s address to a political activity at the party headquarters on Sunday Abela made no mention whatsoever of the court’s cancellation of the hospitals concession first granted to Vitals and then Steward a fiasco which appears to be impacting its lead over the Nationalist Party if the latest surveys are any indication he made no mention to the surveys either The PM also made no mention of the leak of the controversial WhatsApp chats between former Tumas Group CEO Yorgen Fenech and MP Rosianne Cutajar not even to defend his colleague Instead he treaded on familiar grounds in an apparent attempt to project an air of serenity – if not outright denial – on home ground delivering a laundry list of achievements whilst promising as is typical a brighter future ahead For the most part his speech was one he could have easily made months ago or months from now In typical fashion Abela also continued his damnatio memoriae against his predecessor making no mention whatsoever of Joseph Muscat even as he claimed credit on his party’s behalf for “the good we have done in the past 10 years” Similarly avoiding any mentions of Muscat or stating anything specific Abela insisted that his party had “learned from its mistakes and is determined not to repeat them… because that is what the supporters who lent us their trust deserve” “My appeal to you is that you don’t let anyone put on airs humility is the weapon that dismantles the arrogance of others” Abela said Abela’s speech also had what can by now be described as the usual criticism of the Nationalist Party in opposition making a show of unity whilst insisting that the PN “is and will remain divided” “They can only unite briefly to lash out at those who aren’t a part of them… then a week goes by and it’s back to the usual manoeuvring” he said And as he has long done – following on the footsteps of Muscat – he accused the PN of inciting hatred dismissing their recent protests and behaviour in Parliament as an example of this The PN he said is an “elitist clique that acts as though they have a divine right to lead this country a divine right to foster hatred and cruelty They are an arrogant sort that dismiss their critics and armchair critics and those who leave the party as opportunists… they will never leave the door open to you” Predictably Abela assured in this context Labour’s doors remained open to everyone “We are the movement that is open to all We are the movement of workers and also the movement of employers… everyone has a contribution to make” he insisted
"Surveys show Labour’s lead is shrinking, but still comfortable","March 26, 2023 10:18 AM",Tista' taqra bil Malti Surveys published on Sunday’s edition of the Sunday Times of Malta and ItTorċa have both confirmed that the gap between the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party is narrowing in the wake of the hospitals fiasco but would still see Labour comfortably returned to government in the event of an election Neither survey fully accounts for the latest potentiallyembarrassing revelation for the Labour Party – the leak of WhatsApp chats between Yorgen Fenech and MP Rosianne Cutajar – though ItTorċa’s survey carried out by Labour pollster Vincent Marmarà collected responses from 16 to 24 March The Times’ survey carried out by market research firm Esprimi collected responses from 9 to 16 March after the judgment that cancelled the hospitals concession but before the chats were leaked by author and former Labour Party delegate Mark Camilleri In any case both show a narrowing gap between the two major parties though the Nationalist Party may want to hold off on the champagne The Times’ survey found that the PN failed to gain ground with the proportion of people expecting not to vote in the next general election increasing instead and placed the gap between the two parties at 87 which translates to around 23000 votes The 27 who said that they would not vote represent close to 100000 people however Esprimi disclaimed that this figure would likely shrink drastically when an actual election takes place as previous surveys have shown ItTorċa’s survey found that the proportion of voters for the PN was 19 percentage points higher than in last year’s general election still 97 shy of Labour’s share Similarly predicting a drop in turnout the survey translated this gap to 26000 votes – which would increase to 29000 if turnout remained unchanged from last year’s record low Third parties would increase their share somewhat according to both surveys with the Times’s survey estimating that they would gain 55 of the vote while Torċa estimating a more modest 31 In a lengthy reflection on the Torċa survey results Bartolo argued that the Labour Party should not rest on its laurels simply because the result still showed a comfortable gap between the two parties despite everything taking place “There are 14000 Labour voters who would not vote if an election was held tomorrow because they are very unhappy with what is taking place” Bartolo said “I hope that the party does not take the attitude that all is well and no action needs to be taken just because Labour is shown as beating the PN by at least 26000 votes Labour cannot rest assured that the 2027 election is already won” he said In his own reaction to the surveys academic Mario Thomas Vassallo who heads the University of Malta’s Department of Public Policy quoted extensively from George Orwell’s allegorical novella Animal Farm which tells a story of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer only to end up in a state as bad as ever He said that Orwell may have hoped things would be different in the “glass farm of Ħamrun but the dictum that “all animals are equal but some are more equal than others” remained as true as ever “At least today’s surveys show that people are taking note of the obscenities and giving signs that they may yet leave the farm even if they may not be ready to move to the other farm a quarter of a mile away” he said the last a reference to the Nationalist Party and its headquarters a short distance away from Labour’s own

"‘No one believes you’ on hospitals fiasco, Grech tells Labour MPs","May 17, 2023 7:43 PM",Nationalist Party leader Bernard Grech insisted on Wednesday that no one believed what the Labour Party in government was saying on the hospitals concession granted to Vitals passed on to Steward and cancelled by the courts not least since the latest revelations saw the key protagonists openly contradict each other Grech and other PN MPs starting with Adrian Delia completely disregarded the agenda of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting instead focusing solely on hospitals concession following revelations made by the Times and the Shift in collaboration with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project including that former PM Joseph Muscat received money from a firm that was previously called VGH Europe – an apparent reference to Vitals Global Healthcare A few minutes into Delia’s speech – the televised broadcast does not make clear whether he did so of his own accord or in response to informal complaints from the government benches – deputy speaker and PN MP David Agius reminded Delia that the standing orders governing Parliament had not changed and that these required MPs to ensure that their speeches were on topic Delia was undeterred and continued speaking out of order prompting complaints from MP Edward Zammit Lewis which drew a pointed reply from Agius who recalled that PM Robert Abela similarly ignored parliamentary procedure to react to a damning National Audit Office report on the hospitals deal before the public could properly read it “I acted as the Speaker had done two days ago with respect to the prime minister and everyone who spoke after him whose address was not relevant to the agenda of the day” he said before telling Delia that he may continue his address Grech said that the Maltese “are living in surreal times” having to deal shocking revelations while the key government figures were nowhere to be seen He repeatedly highlighted that only a few government MPs were present in the chamber He said that he was not addressing parliament to explain how the hospitals deal was the “greatest fraud that has ever happened in this country” that Abela has lied and that his government was preventing the country’s institutions from doing their duty All of these he said were “a known fact” Instead he said looking straight at the cameras he wished to tell address those “who long for hope in politics and who have a right to hope” including the Labourites “who believed you” he added turning his face to the government benches “Those who had a dream and hoped that this country would move forward only to see you deliver a nightmare instead” he continued The PN leader also said that the latest revelations continue to show why Abela was the chosen successor of Muscat maintaining that Muscat needed someone to ensure the “continuity” that Abela had promised when he became prime minister “It is no wonder that Muscat needed Robert Abela to be his puppet so that he could continue doing as he pleases” he said But in this context Grech emphasised Abela was no victim not least because he was well aware of what he was getting into Grech recalled – as Delia had done earlier in the day – that in the Labour leadership election that saw him prevail over Chris Fearne Abela had maintained that his role as Muscat’s consultant saw him keep an eye on the goingson of every minister Grech also called out Fearne insisting that the health minister could not escape the responsibilities he had concerning the deal He said that Fearne “knows he was a participant and an enabler he knew what was going on and failed to lift a finger to stop the theft that was taking place” Both Fearne and Abela were well aware that Steward were not doing what they were obliged to he later added but they still continued giving it generous amounts of public funds The discussion – which was ostensibly on a bill which would see offences introduced through the latest cannabis reform handled by commissioners for justice rather than the courts – was wound down by justice minister Jonathan Attard who ended up devoting much of his speech to respond to the PN MPs who spoke out – particularly Grech and Delia In doing so Attard repeatedly indulged in an argument his party is fond of making the claim that the PN is split in two camps one backing Grech and the other Delia “The only surreal thing in here… is the opposition leader whose days are numbered” Attard insisted References to Delia prompted the MP to protest loudly prompting Attard to make a pointed remark at the former opposition leader “I know that Delia believes that this is his moment of glory that he can be reintegrated in the party after his own friends kicked him out but he is mistaken” the minister maintained The remark predictably did not help calm things down leading Agius to briefly suspend the sitting Attard also insisted that the opposition was holding the country hostage before concluding his speech by referring to the bill that parliament should have discussed
