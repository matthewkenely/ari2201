Their suspicions were confirmed.Prosecutors said during the arraignment said the drugs found in Mallia's car were not for personal consumption and could have served 60 customers. €1,200 in cash was found in the vehicle.They added that Mallia had also been linked to various service station thefts in Qormi and Luqa, and he also targeted a Qormi shop more than once.Mallia was also accused of causing wilful damage to third-party property and recidivism. He pleaded not guilty.A request for bail was objected to by the prosecution, who argued that this was not a first-time offender and he used to steal to finance his acute drug problem, spending around €300 daily on drugs. He was also an unruly character and there were fears of tampering with evidence.Defence lawyer Matthew Xuereb rebutted that the accused had cooperated fully with investigators and needed help and freedom so he could cure himself. Very frail point in life.Magistrate Marse-Ann Farrugia denied bail in view of the nature of the charges, the criminal record of the accused and the fact that proceedings were in an early stage and civilians still have to testify. Furthermore, there was no assurance that he would abide by bail conditions. Inspectors Clayton Camilleri and Mark Anthony Mercieca prosecuted. ",Qormi
https://timesofmalta.com/,How much does it cost the government to rent an ambulance for a day?,"Health authorities spend €2,500 a day to rent a private ambulance service, Deputy Prime Minister and Health Minister Chris Fearne told parliament on Tuesday.Fearne said that Mater Dei Hospital is paying a private ambulance service, which includes two ambulance respondents with each ambulance, to ensure it can provide an efficient ambulance service. “This costs around €2,500 a day, equivalent to three ambulances and six ambulance respondents daily,” he said. Fearne said the new ambulance contract is based on a leasing contract, which costs €1,705,500 per year and covers the cost of 11 ambulances on the road. He was replying to a parliamentary question asked by Opposition MP Charles Azzopardi.Fearne said the contract was awarded following a competitive process and the ambulances are designed specifically for the needs of the Maltese Health Service.He said the contractor may be liable for any negligence on his part which is not resolved in a short period of time. “These ambulances were gradually introduced to the emergency service, and part of the implementation includes extensive training to ambulance respondents and nurses for them to be able to use all the ambulance equipment.""Back in December, Fearne had announced the introduction of a new fleet of ambulances to be used by Mater Dei's emergency department. He said the new ambulances were “custom-made” for Malta and that they are now “like mobile ITUs”.Fearne had said around 100 calls for ambulances are received every day, amounting to more than 40,000 in a year.The new fleet was introduced a year after ambulance drivers raised their concerns about the working conditions and lack of investment in new vehicles.At the time, the workers and drivers claimed that ambulances being rented from Emergency Malta lacked a full equipment rack, with drivers scrambling to find missing parts from government-owned ambulances. They were informed the old vehicles would be removed and new ones leased, but this also got them questioning why the vehicles were to be leased.In 2020, Mater Dei Hospital's chief operating officer Steve Agius blamed the need for hiring private ambulances on an industrial dispute with union UĦM -Voice of the Workers. The union on the other hand disagreed with Agius and said the government wanted to shift the blame for the situation onto it, saying the government refused to negotiate a new collective agreement for Emergency Ambulance Responders, all while spending ""thousands"" to hire private ambulances.",Msida

https://timesofmalta.com/,Moody's projects Malta's economy to grow by 6.2% this year,"Ratings agency Moody's has confirmed Malta's A2 negative.In a report issued late on Tuesday, it praised the country for the growth and divisification of its economy, adding that the negative outlook reflected a significant increase in the government's debt burden, as well as uncertainties tied to the broader economic recovery, particularly the recovery of the tourism sector. It also reflects the addition of Malta to the “grey list” of the Financial ActionTask Force (FATF) over concerns related to anti-money laundering supervision.The ratings agency had changed Malta's outlook from stable to negative in August last year.Last week, Fitch Ratings has affirmed Malta's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' with a stable outlook.In its latest report, Moody's said that it expects the Maltese economy to grow by 4.2% of GDP in 2022, a relatively robust rate in light of the weakening economic outlook in Europe. Domestic consumption and investment will be important drivers of growth. The pace of economic expansion this year will also be dependent on the extent to which tourism arrivals in Malta begin approaching pre-pandemic levels.""Our forecast assumes that total tourist arrivals in 2022 will be roughly two-thirds of 2019 levels, having reached 35% of 2019 levels in 2021,"" it says. Although Malta's direct exposure to economic spillover effects from the Russia-Ukraine conflict is limited, the impact of the military conflict on growth and inflation across much of Europe risks also weighing on Malta's growth outlook for 2022, it adds.Inflation is estimated to have reached 4.9% in April, up from 2.6% in December 2021. Despite the increase,  Malta's current rate of inflation is among the lowest in the euro area and clearly below the 7.5% figure for the euro area as a whole in April, Moody's observes. It  said it expects the deficit will remain elevated in 2022 – but the debt burden is likely to stay below sixty percent of GDP.""The continued economic rebound and gradual phasing out of pandemic-related support measures will drive an improvement in the public finances this year,"" it says.It said it expects the government debt to stand at 59.5% of GDP at the end of 2022, markedly below its own August 2021 forecast of debt at 68.2% of GDP in 2022, due to much higher economic growth and a significantly lower deficit in 2021 than we had previously forecast.  As for Malta's greylisting by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force's (FATF), Moody's notes that the government has worked with the FATF and the Council of Europe's anti-money laundering body Moneyval to strengthen the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering regime.The efforts made by the Maltese government were recognized by FATF at its February 2022 plenary, when it was assessed that Malta had substantially completed its action plan. This was followed by an on-site visit by FATF and MoneyVal to Malta in April to verify that the implementation of the key reforms of the action plan were being implemented and sustained and that the political commitment to sustain implementation and further improvements remained in place. A formal decision on whether to remove Malta from the grey list could at the earliest come at the FATF plenary in June this year.The key measures adopted as part of Malta's action plan have focused on improving the accuracy of its beneficial ownership regime, enhancing the use of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in pursuing criminal tax and related money laundering cases, as well as increasing the focus of FIU's analysis on these types of issues.",
https://timesofmalta.com/,"80 jury trials pending in Maltese courts, some dating back 13 years","Eighty court cases are currently waiting to be tried by a jury in Maltese courts, the majority of which are stalled due to a variety of legal issues, figures tabled in parliament on Tuesday revealed. Some of these trials go as far back as 13 years, with one delayed court case dating back as far as February 2008. Justice Minister Jonathan Attard tabled the figures in a reply to a parliamentary question by Opposition MP Karol Aquilina. In Malta's justice system, jury trials are reserved for crimes that are deemed too serious to be heard before a court of magistrates. Attard said that of the 80 pending jury trials, eight have had a trial date fixed and are on course to be held, while another seven are awaiting a trial date. The remaining 65 cases, however, remain pending due to legal issues. In some cases, the minister said, the cases are subject to constitutional proceedings which must be concluded before the case can go to trial. In others, other related cases must be concluded first, or the cases are still in their preliminary stages. Delays in Maltese courts have been flagged as an area of major concern by the EU, with criminal, civil and administrative proceedings all taking longer to be completed than the EU average. Criminal cases in Malta take an average of 298 days to complete, more than double the EU median of 122 days. Delays are even longer for second-instance cases, which take an average of 534 days compared to the 104-day EU average.The government has acknowledged that the criminal justice system requires reform and last year then-Justice Minister Edward Zammit Lewis hinted that one option being considered is to do away with the compilation of evidence stage that comes prior to trial. Talks then began as to how to reform the criminal justice system, with sources telling Times of Malta that the intention is to remove certain parts of the compilation process, without doing away with it entirely. The Chamber of Advocates said earlier this year that those talks are “at an advanced stage”.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,EU approves €30 million Malta government scheme to support grain prices,"The European Commission has approved a €30 million Malta government scheme to support companies in the importation, wholesale and manufacture of grain products impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The scheme, 'MDB Subsidised Loan Scheme', was approved under the State aid Temporary Crisis Framework adopted by the Commission on March 23, which recognises that the EU economy is experiencing a serious disturbance.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put massive pressure on wheat prices, as both countries are major producers and exporters of grain.Back in March, Malta's top wheat importers sounded the alarm about the possibility that other countries will start to restrict exports and has called for a national strategy on the importation of wheat.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Robert Abela said ""millions of euro"" have been allocated to keep flour prices stable.Under this new measure, the aid will take the form of subsidised loans.European Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of the competition policy said the €30 million scheme will enable Malta to mitigate the economic impact of Putin's war in Ukraine and “to support companies active in the importation of grains and other similar products affected by the current geopolitical crisis.”“We continue to stand with Ukraine and its people. At the same time, we continue working closely with Member States to ensure that national support measures can be put in place in a timely, coordinated, and effective way while protecting the level playing field in the Single Market,” he said.Malta had notified the commission under the Temporary Crisis Framework of the €30 million scheme to support companies of all sizes active in the importation, manufacturing and wholesale of grains and other similar products in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The loan is limited to two years. All loan contracts must be signed by December 31 2022.Nationalist Party spokesperson Peter Agius, who first called on the European Commission to safeguard prices, welcomed the news on Wednesday.""This is politics which shows results. Following pressure from Bernard Grech, the European Commission today approved a €30 million aid scheme to help Maltese consumers on the price of bread. We will continue to work,"" he said.",
https://timesofmalta.com/,Deportations are forcing people traffickers to shift operations - minister,"A record number of migrant repatriations over the past months has contributed to people smugglers changing their tactics, with fewer migrants heading for Malta, Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri said on Wednesday.Speaking in parliament, the minister said Malta would continue to observe its international obligations and could not let any migrants drown. But it could also not have an open-door policy for migration.It was not just laws and obligations to safeguard migrants which needed to be observed, but also laws and obligations concerning the national border and security, he said.Those people who were genuinely deserving of international protection were being given a good, professional service but the country was also increasingly addressing the situation of those who were not entitled to international protection and did not have a right to live here. The fact that a record number of migrants had been sent back to their country of origin had served as a signal to the people who demanded fairness in the handling of the migration challenge, and a signal too to the people traffickers.Indeed, Malta had seen a shift in the number and the nationality of arrivals, with migrants going to other countries and criminal traffickers realising their 'business model' was not succeeding.  The setting up of the Returns Unit, which works closely with the Immigration Police and the Foreign Ministry had given good results and a direct correlation could be seen between its work and a decrease in migrant arrivals.It was in this context that the Immigration Act was being amended to facilitate deportations and remove problematic areas of the law – such as those irregular migrants who arrived by air had to be returned on the same plane they arrived on, something which was often impractical.The law also tackled problems of unaccompanied minors and provided that the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers could be appointed as the interim guardian of such people.Camilleri said the government would continue to tackle the migration challenge fairly but firmly. To delay decisions often caused hardship for genuine asylum seekers, while those who abused the system continued to thrive.Action would therefore continue to be taken locally but also abroad, not least to deter and discourage migrant departures from Libya. The challenge would persist and it was the government's duty to create better structures to handle it, he said.",
https://timesofmalta.com/,MP calls for register of people convicted of domestic violence,"Malta should consider a system that would allow the police to disclose information to women or men about their partner's previous history of abuse, Rosianne Cutajar told parliament on Wednesday.The Labour MP said Malta has made major steps forward to address domestic violence. But over 500 domestic violence reports were filed in the first four months of this year. While it was good that such cases had been reported, this also showed that more must be done, she said.  “We have a dedicated unit in the police corps, we provide free legal aid for domestic violence victims and we have a full-time domestic violence commissioner, but more is needed,” Cutajar said.“Now is the time to explore the possibility of having a register of those people who have a history of abuse or domestic violence. People have the right to know if their partner has a history of abuse.”Such a facility is already available in the UK - the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, better known as Clare's Law. The law is so named after Clare Wood, a woman murdered in England by a former partner who police knew to be dangerous.Clare's Law enables the police to disclose information to a victim or potential victim of domestic abuse about their partner's or ex-partner's previous abusive or violent offending. The law is intended to reduce intimate partner violence. Cutajar also referred to how a woman who was kicked, punched and held captive for several hours saw her aggressor walk away without any effective consequences. “The aggressor admitted his actions in court, but nothing was done. It is already very difficult for these people to come forward and report abuse, but when they read such stories, they lose all hope in our courts,” she said.Cutajar said the people deserved a court that helped them, and not a system where cases dragged on for years. She said a number of laws relating to the structure of the family were a ""result of the past"" and need a revamp.She provided examples such as children's custody, and how more often than not, the mother is given full custody of the child. ""Parent's access to their child needs to be more balanced, such a balance will be beneficial for both the parents and the child,"" she said.""We have made a lot of progress, but we must be realistic when it comes to the courts, we need more reforms and change.""",
https://timesofmalta.com/,Steward Healthcare fully bound by conditions of original contract- Fearne,"Steward Healthcare is fully bound by the conditions of the original contract between Vitals and the government for the running of state hospitals, once it had fully taken over the concession, Health Minister Chris Fearne told parliament on Wednesday.Replying to a question by Opposition MP Beppe Fenech Adami on whether there had been progress in talks on contract conditions, Fearne said it was natural that all concessionaires wanted more favourable conditions, but once Steward had fully taken over the Vitals concession, it was fully bound by the contract conditions.  Changes to the substance of the contract could not be made.The US healthcare provider is running three state hospitals, Karin Grech, St Luke's and the Gozo General Hospital, as part of a multi-million deal after it took over from the original concession from Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH) in 2015.The €4 billion hospital contract hinged on the promise that the private investors would spend €220 million to completely revamp the health facilities. However, VGH sold the concession to Steward Healthcare after two years.“We fully expect that the service (by Steward) is provided according to the concession agreement,” Fearne said.Fearne added that from a health service perspective, the service given to patients at Gozo hospital was very good and had improved over the years.Referring to various court proceedings currently underway regarding the concession, Fearne said the outcome would be interesting in view of their impact on the government's relationship with the company.Earlier this year, Prime Minister Robert Abela said talks between the government and Steward Health Care about their concession agreement are at a standstill. Stewards is also refusing to pay €36.5 million in unpaid taxes and has taken the tax commissioner to court to resolve the dispute.",

It was a 27 minute call that was recorded. In the last minute or so he made some ""rough, serious threats"" making reference to ""the weapon,"" prosecutors said.He was promptly rearrested.Monsigneur was accused of attempted grievous bodily harm, carrying a knife without police licence, breaching the peace, assault, harassing a Social Security Department official and causing him to fear violence.He was further accused of threatening and insulting officials, misuse of electric communications equipment, breach of bail and recidivism.Inspectors Clayton Camilleri and Andy Rotin objected to bail, saying the accused has an anger management problem, and such behaviour was unacceptable in society. They pointed out that when granted police bail he committed further wrongdoing.""Not true jaħasra! "" the man complained from the dock.

https://timesofmalta.com/,Malta to be taken to European court over 'discriminatory' car registration tax,"The European Commission said on Thursday it will take Malta to court over its discriminatory rules on registering cars and other motor vehicles imported from the EU. Malta's reply to the Commission's reasoned opinion on the matter was not deemed to be satisfactory so the country will be referred to the European Union's Court of Justice for taxing used cars imported from other member states more heavily than used cars purchased on the Maltese market.The step follows the time given to Malta to rectify the situation after the Commission said that Malta was discriminating in its car registration tax.According to Maltese tax rules, cars registered after 2009 and imported from other EU states are taxed more heavily than similar cars registered in Malta before that date.The rules were put in place by the government in 2008 in a bid to protect local car import companies from far cheaper second-hand imports from the EU. Brussels had opened infringement proceedings against Malta over the rules which it says are incompatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), prohibiting discrimination against imported products.The Maltese car taxation system does not take into account the date of first registration of the vehicle, where registration took place in another member state, it said.It holds that the Maltese car taxation system has a discriminatory effect with respect to motor vehicles coming from other EU states.The bulk of second-hand vehicles imported into Malta used to come from the United Kingdom although this has somewhat changed since Brexit.The Commission said on Thursday that, in the absence of harmonisation of car taxes, each member state can arrange its tax measures in accordance with its own assessments.However, the TFEU requires each member state to select and arrange car taxes in such a way that they do not have the effect of promoting sales of domestic second-hand cars and so discourage the transfer of similar second-hand cars from other member states.This discriminatory effect is not compatible with Article 110 TFEU, which prohibits discrimination against imported products, the statement read.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,Can artificial intelligence solve the traffic problem?,"Malta is turning to Artificial Intelligence to reduce traffic congestion, improve the distribution of energy and avoid scenarios of out-of-stock medicine among others through an investment of €4 million.The funds will be injected in six national projects led by the Malta Digital Innovation Authority:-Management traffic project (€2million). Existing traffic lights, CCTV and display panels systems will be incorporated into one system to be able to draw up traffic patterns and understand better what is causing congestion. The project would eventually help reduce congestion and time spent in traffic as the information will be passed on to Transport Malta's control centre, which will in turn distribute the information among motorists through apps such as Google Maps.-Understand and better manage energy load distribution across the island by collecting data from ARMS, Enemalta and Water Service Corporation (€376,000). Analysing the data collected through these three entities would allow the same entities to maximise their resources and provide real-time support. It would also become possible to forecast problems by analysing past data. This investment is a stepping stone towards the implementation of a smart grid network that would see energy clients receiving information about possible energy wastage at home.-24/7 chatbot for servizz.gov and 153 phone clients (€590,000). The chatbot service will be in Maltese and English and will help clients avoid having to physically turn up at one of the branches if they don't find the information they require online.-Personalised educational programmes depending on children's achievements, skills and their aspirations (€150,000).-Analysing budget and stock levels of the health services' Central Procurement Supply Unit (€300,000). The system would help forecast demand and supply to avoid out-of-stock medicine.-A system that creates what is known as digital tourist 'personas' depending on visitors' interests, lifestyle and demographics (€800,000). With the help of these personas, the Malta Tourism Authority would be able to better understand what tourists are actually after and can draft policies and initiatives based on visitors' changing interests.All six projects are set to be completed by 2023, with the traffic management project being completed by 2024.The AI systems are being applied to scenarios that involve a huge amount of data that cannot be processed manually, Minister Silvio Schembri assured at a press conference on Thursday.The projects, he added, formed part of the national AI strategy, with the ultimate aim being to support citizens in their everyday life, incentivise research and ensure progress in the health and education sectors.""We aspire to become a place from where companies can set up and develop AI systems. Through these projects we can also show that Malta can adapt to such new technologies.""AI, he noted, could be adapted to everyday processes that most take for granted. The strategy was launched in 2019, but the launch of projects required a lot of research, he said.MDIA CEO Kenneth Brincat told the same conference that a further €500,000 had been invested in research and scholarships.Since the strategy's launch in 2019, the authority itself had carried out research and work to ensure that its aims are effectively implemented by 2030.He added that the authority's most important role was its regulatory responsibilities.Brincat said that while Malta already had a certified regulatory programme for the AI sector, the EU was still discussing a mandatory regulatory framework.

https://timesofmalta.com/,Maltese volunteer in Poland: 'It is our moral obligation' to help Ukrainians,"A Maltese woman who travelled to Poland to help Ukrainian refugees has recounted stories of broken lives and the tireless work of brave volunteers, as she appealed for funds for a foundation that supports a temporary home for displaced mothers and children.Money is what is needed right now to keep providing shelter for Ukrainians and support those who remained in the war-torn country, where food and medical supplies are running low, said Pia Vassallo.“With €10, a family can be fed; €20 would pay for their transport; €100 evacuates a family from Lviv; €500 provides medicines and other essentials for a small community in Ukraine; and €1,500 pays for a bus shuttle to evacuate over 50 people,” she said.Vassallo spent her time in Lublin driving hundreds of kilometres to load and unload supplies and transport refugees to their next destination “on the journey they never thought they would have to take”.Displaced persons she encountered and supported during the “demanding yet fulfilling” experience were put up in a shelter of the Zmieniamy Życie Foundation, Liliowa 5.Until some time ago, it was just your standard home address in Lublin, but since the Russian invasion, it has housed some 2,000 refugees before finding them more permanent accommodation.Liliowa 5 was the home of a selfless Polish couple, who moved into a hostel and turned it into a shelter for displaced Ukrainians, Vassallo recounted.Small footnotes in a long journeyAlong the way, Vassallo met Igor, who has been battling skin cancer for the last five years, and, together with his wife, had to leave Kyiv.She was asked to drive him from Lubartow to a meeting point close to the Slovakian border, from where, thanks to the hard work of many, he travelled to a hospital in Salzburg to continue his treatment.“While we were saying our goodbyes to Igor, Russian bombs were falling on Lviv, just 100km away,” Vassallo recounted.She also picked up two best friends and their five children, who left for Poland when their village was destroyed, leaving their husbands behind to fight.But just as they had started to feel safe again and the kids had started school, they were asked to leave their accommodation.They reached out to the Zmieniamy Życie Foundation and Vassallo headed off on a five-hour round trip to collect them and transfer them to the Liliowa 5 home.“This is just one stop – one small footnote – in their long journey,” she said.“They are war victims; they've seen things no one should experience in their lifetime; they have no money; they cannot speak Polish… They have had to leave everything behind and flee destruction and death and yet still want to say thank you for the very little you are doing.”Among her heart-breaking encounters was a 14-year-old boy travelling with his mother and Labrador pup.He explained how they had to flee their home in Kherkov and were waiting to leave the temporary shelter for Estonia. His English was broken but his sorrowful, expressive eyes spoke volumes and have remained impressed in her memory.“This senseless war has destroyed their homes and broken up their communities and families. But it has not broken their spirit.“I have seen confusion and fear in their eyes, but I have also seen determination. The Ukrainians are truly beautiful, resilient people,” Vassallo said, insisting “it is our moral obligation to help them”.Dropping everything to help strangersThe foundation volunteers, whom Vassallo joined, are organising transport for Ukrainian refugees and places to stay abroad even though most want to remain in neighbouring Poland in the hope of returning to Ukraine soon to rebuild their country and lives.Until a short while ago, these volunteers were normal people living their own lives too.Now, they have dropped everything to help strangers, she said, touched by the fact that she has experienced “so much love and generosity amidst so much needless destruction and despair”.Tireless Toni, a young landscape gardener, from Rye, the UK, was there because he is an orphan and wanted to bring comfort to Ukrainian kids fleeing for their lives.“He has been on the border every day, doing 14-hour shifts, with no intention to go back home.”Most of the founders of the Zmieniamy Życie Foundation are Polish living in Malta, or who have ties with the island.They have left everything behind to go to Lublin and were willing to risk their own safety to drive into Ukraine with provisions, including body bags.“They are not crazy adrenalin junkies, but aware of the dangers and worried,” Vassallo said.Back from Poland, she said she felt lucky and grateful, but also helpless as she goes about her daily life.“People keep asking me how it was. I am not sure how to answer…“It was real,” she said about the emotional experience. “The Ukrainians are fighting not just for their lives; they are fighting for their country, their freedom. They are also fighting for our way of life.“I have nothing but respect for their bravery and integrity.”Donations to the foundation can be made here.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,Judge insists on legislation on electronic tagging of people out on bail,"Electronic tagging of persons granted bail pending criminal proceedings would ensure better protection for society, whilst placing less onerous conditions upon the accused who is still presumed innocent, a judge has declared.In a strongly-worded decree upholding the request for bail for Terence Cini, who stands accused of conspiring to import 34 kilograms of cannabis grass, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera reiterated her call for legislative changes to introduce such a “remote control” system over persons undergoing criminal proceedings.Cini was arrested alongside Kevin Mifsud late one Saturday evening in February following days of surveillance by the police Drug Squad which placed officers on the trail of a van that was driven to a Zebbug garage shortly after disembarking from Sicily.Two cars driven by the suspects were intercepted by the officers as they emerged from the garage.A search of the van subsequently yielded a bag containing €300,000 in cash, as well as 34 one-kilo packets of cannabis grass, worth some €700,000.Upon arraignment both men pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges.But whereas his co-accused was later granted bail, Cini was still in preventive custody, three months since his arraignment on February 15, observed the judge.A fresh request for bail was objected to by the prosecution although all civilian witnesses had testified and evidence was preserved in the records of the magisterial inquiry.The Attorney General's major concern stemmed from fear that Cini would not abide by bail conditions.Judge Scerri Herrera said that did not mean that the court could not counter that fear in such manner as to strike a balance between justice owed to society and the accused's own interests, pointing out that imprisonment was the exception while personal liberty was the rule.She observed that according to recent pronouncements by the Constitutional Court, for the accused to be kept under preventive arrest there was not only to be a reasonable suspicion of his alleged wrongdoing, but also relevant and sufficient reasons to justify interfering in the person's liberty.In this light, electronic tagging would offer a twofold benefit.Such “telematics monitoring” or remote control of the person granted bail would mean that society is better protected while less onerous bail conditions would be called for.The judge said the court's repeated calls for the legislator to take action in this regard, had so far gone unheeded.Since the State had failed to provide “adequate mechanisms” to monitor the movements of a person out on bail, the court said it placed that responsibility on the police, by ordering them to make repeated and surprise visits to ensure that Cini abided by court orders.The main purpose of bail was to ensure that the accused turned up in court whenever due.The court thus granted bail against a deposit of €20,000, a personal guarantee of €30,000, daily signing of the bail book and other conditions, besides regular monitoring by the police.The judge ordered that a copy of her decree be sent to the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers in the hope of bringing about the necessary legislative intervention.By creating an adequate mechanism, the State would cut down on crimes committed by persons while out on bail, concluded the judge.Lawyers Franco Debono, Alfred Abela and Marion Camilleri are defence counsel.",
https://timesofmalta.com/,Court to inspect proposed restaurant underneath old Valletta university,"A judge presiding over injunction proceedings against allegedly 'illegal' works on a new restaurant beneath the old University Campus in Merchants' Street, Valletta, ordered an onsite visit on Thursday afternoon.That order was issued by Mr Justice Grazio Mercieca at the end of an animated hearing on Thursday morning when lawyers for the university and the individual undertaking works at the new restaurant crossed swords over the controversial project.The university resorted to legal action and obtained a provisional injunction blocking the works, after a judicial protest filed against Charles Foca, the man responsible for the development, proved futile.The university says it had not been consulted in any way and had missed out on the chance to file an objection against the proposed eatery, specialising in Asian and Mediterranean cuisine.  The owner of the premises is the Lands Authority which, as administrator of government property, had informed the Planning Authority that it did not approve the proposed development.In his reply to the injunction application, Foca argued that he was handling the works on behalf of Mark Portelli, who held the premises under title of lease.Lawyer Carlos Bugeja, appearing for the university, said that the permit had been issued in Foca's name.He said the works involved two properties, one of which had obtained a licence which Bugeja claimed was “irregular,” and another which had no permit.Yet the restaurant project was still going ahead, posing a “great hazard” not only to the historic building lying directly above it but also to all the academics, students and staff frequenting the old campus, he said. At the start of the hearing, Foca's lawyer, Timothy Bartolo, declared that there would be no gas cylinders inside the new restaurant since all appliances were electric.But the university's lawyer sought to poke holes in that statement.Reading from documents submitted for planning purposes, Bugeja pointed out that Foca had declared that the restaurant was to make use of fossil fuel, specifically gas.The maximum electricity demand was to be met by means of a single-phase meter which would surely not support a fully electrically operated system.And with a projected annual consumption of 1000 units of electricity, Foca's claim was hardly “credible,” argued Bugeja.The university was also concerned about the lack of proper ventilation in the restaurant below, with carbon monoxide fumes likely to flow from one room to another with no outer-looking window.“One spark is all it would take,” argued Bugeja. Those arguments were promptly described by Foca's lawyer as painting an “apocalyptic” scenario based on “fear” rather than legal grounds to justify the injunction.There must be a right to safeguard and an irremediable prejudice to be suffered if that injunction were to be confirmed, said Bartolo.The university was neither the owner, nor the lessee.Moreover “I can today declare that in this place there will not be one gas cylinder,” insisted Foca's lawyer, supporting his claim with photos filed along with his written reply.He said the restaurant had gone through all the regular stages of planning and works were carried out under the constant supervision of heritage authorities.The university did not object, not even to the commencement notice of works, he observed.But the opponent's lawyer immediately rebutted that the first application had gone through because the university was not duly notified.“The second application, the one we knew about, was withheld because we objected.”Faced with those arguments, the court declared that it would rather hold an onsite visit to the Valletta premises.The case continues.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,No Monkeypox cases reported in Malta but doctors have been alerted,"Updated 3.35pm to include newly-discovered case in Italy.There are currently no confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox in Malta, health authorities have confirmed, as cases of the virus spread in Europe.Monkeypox is a rare disease that is usually linked to contact with wild animals in west and central Africa. Cases have been detected in the UK, Spain and Portugal as well as the United States over the past weeks.Italy reported its first case on Thursday, saying it was identified in a young adult who had recently returned from the Canary Islands. He is being treated in isolation and is in a reasonable condition. Two other suspected cases are being investigated.Canada said it is investigating more than a dozen suspected casesA spokesperson for the Health Ministry that no cases have been detected locally and doctors have been alerted to watch out for patients who may be exhibiting symptoms. “There are no confirmed or suspected cases reported in Malta,” the spokesperson said. “The health authorities are monitoring the situation and they have alerted doctors to notify any suspected cases.”Symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than smallpox. Infected people develop flu-like symptoms — fever, body aches, chills, but also swollen lymph nodes.Nine cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the UK since May 6, 30 suspected cases in Spain and Portugal as well as one confirmed case in the US. Most people who contract the virus tend to recover in a few weeks and it has only been fatal in very rare cases. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation said that it had been notified that one cluster of the virus in the UK had emerged from the same household, while four additional cases were reported through sexual health services, where a cluster of male gay and bisexual patients presented with a rash as well as symptoms of illness. The source of infection has yet to be confirmed, the WHO added, but evidence suggested that this was may have been acquired locally in the UK. Isolation of the patients, as well as intensive contact tracing, was ongoing, they said. ""We really need to better understand the extent of monkeypox in endemic countries... to really understand how much is circulating and the risk that it poses for people who are living there, as well as the risk of exportation,"" infectious disease epidemiologist Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said at a WHO press conference on Tuesday.The WHO also reported that on May 7, an individual returned to the UK after travelling to Nigeria and subsequently tested positive for monkeypox, however, this case does not appear to be related to the previously mentioned clusters. The UK Health Security Agency said that while monkeypox has not previously been listed as a sexually transmitted disease, it may be passed on by direct contact during sex. The America Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement on Wednesday that monkeypox can be spread through contact with monkeypox sores or items that have been contaminated with fluids or sorer. The WHO has not recommended any restrictions for travel or trade with the United Kingdom, based on the current information and will continue to monitor the situation. ",

All four victims were black.Both men have been granted bail, a decision that instilled fear, humiliation and disappointment among black people and the migrant community.

https://timesofmalta.com/,Burn': Man convicted of hate speech following one-word post,"A man who posted the word “burn” beneath a story about a black migrant has been given a suspended sentence for hate speech and fined €2000.56-year old St Paul's Bay resident Mark Vella posted the single-worded comment beneath a Lovin Malta article published in October 2021. The story concerned a migrant living in Malta and attracted a thread of comments by readers. One ran along the lines that: “They'll go up to Mount Carmel and they'll release him a few days later. Then they'll go to court, give him a small fine and back out he goes.”Another reader added, “this is the thanks we get.”That was where Vella joined the discussion and his comment was, “Aħraq (burn).”That single word was enough to trigger investigations by the police, who tracked down the suspect.Vella released a police statement on March 15 and police then charged him with incitement to hatred as well as misuse of electronic communications equipment.After hearing submissions by both parties the court, presided over by magistrate Ian Farrugia, observed that the accused's comment was to be taken in context.The comment had been directed towards a “dark-skinned” foreign national living in Marsa and that context was significant, given the considerable number of such foreigners living in that area.Taken in that context, the accused's single-worded comment, “Aħraq,” allowed no room for doubt, said the court, concluding that such comment amounted to “threatening and abusive speech” that incited hatred.The court made reference to three judgments delivered in separate cases, stating that it had borne in mind the “clear and unequivocal pronouncements” made therein.The most recent was a judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal against Brandon Bartolo, who was found guilty in 2019 of inciting racial hatred through comments posted on anti-migrant Ghaqda Patrijotti Maltin's Facebook page, targeting social inclusion campaigner Sara Ezabe.In that case, Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera had quashed the accused's previous acquittal by the Magistrates' Court, declaring that in such cases the prosecution did not need to prove the accused's intention to insult.It sufficed to prove the publication of such comments which, in the mind of the average reader, would lower esteem vis-à-vis the subject targeted by those comments, the appeals court declared.In light of such considerations, Magistrate Farrugia declared that the charges were sufficiently proved, thus condemning the accused to a three-month jail term suspended for two years as well as a fine of €2,000.",
https://timesofmalta.com/,Finger marks found around neck of woman strangled to death in Gozo,"Finger marks and bruises were found around the neck of a woman who was allegedly strangled to death by her partner in an apartment in Gozo, court-appointed experts testified on Friday.Forensic doctor Mario Scerri and two pathologists who conducted autopsies on the corpse of Rita Ellul said the victim had fingerprints around her neck and also severe bruising in various parts of her body.Doctors Ali Salfraz and Olaf Woods confirmed that “her cause of death was asphyxia due to manual pressure applied to the neck”.They were testifying in the compilation of evidence against Lawrence Abina, 30, who is pleading not guilty to murdering Ellul on February 26.Ellul was found dead in her bed in an Għajnsielem apartment. In a previous court sitting, a police inspector had testified that Abina confessed to the crime while under interrogation.Scerri explained that he had at first been summoned after Ellul's lifeless body was discovered in bed.He said he was immediately suspicious because Ellul was only wearing a tracksuit and no socks, with only her legs covered with the quilt and the bed done up. However, he had nothing to back his suspicions as the body had no external visible marks.The corpse was taken to hospital and that was where he saw the bruises and swelling around the eyes which was a clear indication of asphyxia due to pressure on the neck.

https://timesofmalta.com/,Russians topped Malta's list of new citizens in 2020,"More Russian nationals were granted Maltese citizenship in 2020 than the following two countries combined, new EU figures confirm.Data published by Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, shows that 175 Russians received Maltese citizenship in 2020, the highest figure for any nationality.A further 54 Libyans were also granted citizenship, as were 52 citizens from the Philippines. Overall, 1,181 applicants were granted Maltese citizenship that year, meaning close to 15 per cent of all recipients were Russian nationals.Citizenship can be obtained through several methods ranging from marriage to descent, naturalisation or, in some cases such as Malta, investment. The Eurostat figures do not provide context about the reasons for which citizenship was granted.  Across the EU, Moroccan, Syrian and Albanian applicants were the most common new citizens in 2020. Over 68,000 Moroccans now call themselves European, as do some 50,000 Syrians and 40,000 Albanians.Cyprus and Finland were the only two other EU member states where Russian nationals topped their respective citizenship lists in 2020. Cyprus, like Malta, operated a citizenship-by-investment scheme in 2020. That scheme was suspended in November of that year following a corruption scandal. Finland shares a land border with Russia and the two countries have several historic ties. The granting of Maltese citizenship has made both local and international headlines since 2013, when the Labour government introduced the citizenship-by-investment programme soon after it rose to power. Malta's Individual Investor Programme, as it was known, allowed non-EU nationals to effectively purchase Maltese citizenship, obtaining freedom of movement and access to EU financial systems.The IIP scheme was revamped in 2020 to introduce stricter residency requirements, but Malta continues to face intense pressure at EU level to drop the scheme altogether.Russians are currently banned from applying for Maltese citizenship following the invasion of Ukraine, with pending applications currently frozen. Malta has also revoked the citizenship of a Russian national named on a US sanctions list.The government had initially resisted pressure to stop selling passports to Russian applications, arguing due diligence processes were thorough and prevented abuse.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had urged Malta to “stop the privileges of Russian people, including golden passports and dual citizenship"" when he addressed Malta's parliament earlier in May.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,Maltese courts slowest in EU when dealing with money laundering cases,"Malta's courts remain the slowest in Europe to close money laundering cases, taking around three years to close off suits, fresh figures issued by the European Commission show. According to the EU Justice Scoreboard 2022, which presents an annual overview of efficiency, quality, and independence of justice systems across the EU, Malta's court took over 1,200 days to close money laundering cases in 2019. Data for 2020 and 2021 was not included. The country's rate was the highest when compared to the rest of Europe and was notably higher than the 900 days registered by Slovenia, which had the second slowest rate.Malta's court delays have often come under fire from the EU, with the Commission flagging the issue as being of ""serious concern"" in a rule of law report published almost a year ago, in July 2021.At the time, the government had said the Commission had welcomed the reforms its was implementing to strengthen the independence of the justice system, particularly the reform of the system of judicial appointments and that of judicial discipline.""In addition to contributing to the fight against crime, the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering is crucial for the soundness, integrity and stability of the financial sector, confidence in the financial system and fair competition in the single market,"" the Commission said in its scoreboard. Despite still being the slowest to close money laundering cases, Malta's courts have registered an improvement. In 2018, the year prior to that in review, courts took around 2,200 days - around six years - to close money laundering proceedings. The scoreboard also confirmed Malta's courts were the slowest to resolve administrative cases in 2020, taking around 900 days to close proceedings. Malta's system was also exceptionally slow when dealing with cases related to competition law, taking a whopping 3,400 days to close proceedings, the highest rate in Europe by a wide margin. In a statement on Friday, the Justice Ministry noted that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, courts were not operating for ""a good part of the year"". ""However, Malta registered a decrease in the pending caseload in litigious civil and commercial cases, as well as a decrease in the length of proceedings of money laundering cases when compared to 2019,"" the government said. The scoreboard does not include data on the length of proceedings of money laundering cases for 2020, with the lastest figures included by the Commission being for 2019. ""The Ministry for Justice welcomes the publication of the EU JS 22 with a sense of commitment to improve the efficiency of justice and reaffirms its mandate to help justice transition to a more digitalised era, improve its accessibility, and promote public confidence in the justice system.""The ministry acknowledges the efforts of all stakeholders, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and looks forward to furthering the cooperation with them in the coming years."" It added that as pledged in the electoral manifesto, the government is committed to ""addressing the efficiency of justice by implementing new landmark reforms"". ",
https://timesofmalta.com/,"Man who wished migrants drown off Malta gets €350 fine, conditional discharge","A man accused of hate speech over a Facebook comment he posted two years ago, turned up to court on Friday without a lawyer.Roderick Abela, who represented himself, was conditionally discharged and fined €350.Abela had commented under a story published on Television Malta's Facebook page in May 2020 about a group of migrants who were denied entry into Malta and were instead kept on board a Captain Morgan vessel.“May they all drown because enough is enough… we're fed up of you, taking us for a ride for 15 years and abusing the generosity of a weak nation lacking guts,” he wrote.Abela was contacted about the matter more than two years since posting that comment, explained Abela when he turned up for the sitting on Friday, unassisted by a lawyer out of choice.The delay was in itself not in the interest of justice, started off the man, after informing Magistrate Ian Farrugia that he wished to make some arguments against the charges of incitement to hatred and misuse of electronic communications equipment.Referring to article 82A of the Criminal Code, the accused argued that his comment did not qualify as “threatening, abusive nor insulting"". Nor had the police produced evidence to show whether the migrants were “muslims, Africans, Hindu…” went on the man, questioning how he could be found guilty of inciting hatred on the basis of race, gender, religion and so forth.He also lacked criminal intent.'May they all drown' may have been an 'insensitive comment' and a negative wish but that did not mean that it was illegal, went on Abela, adding that he apologised but stood firm by his arguments in favour of acquittal.“Your arguments are valid and lucid,” remarked the magistrate when the man standing before him wrapped up his defence.However, the allegedly offensive post was not to be assessed “in a vacuum,” explained the court, delving into an analysis of the situation, simplifying the legal arguments at stake.That comment was targeted against a specified group of migrants, within Maltese territorial waters.The law spoke about the “probability” that such a comment could incite hatred or violence.As for the criminal intent, that was for the court to determine after assessing the evidence put forward and, in this particular case, evidence pointed in the direction of such criminal intent, explained the magistrate.“'May they all drown' left no doubt as to your intention,” said magistrate Farrugia, pointing out that the charges carried a maximum fine of €25,000.The accused noted that the “spur of the moment” comment was posted at a time when Malta was facing the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore also reflected “an element of frustration"".The court conditionally discharged the accused for one year and imposed a €350 fine.“You have a right to an opinion... opinion is free but not absolute,” was the magistrate's final word of advice.

https://timesofmalta.com/,Watch: Stories of the dead to be told at Mtarfa cemetery,"In 1956, a young man in Suez thought he had struck it lucky when his friend gave him an air ticket, which he had won in a raffle, to travel back to the UK where the man's mother was quite ill.But A. Smith was killed, along with 49 others, when the Scottish plane Avro York crashed in fields outside Żurrieq, near the Blue Grotto, after a stopover in Malta.With him were 12 Royal Air Force personnel who had won their tickets in a “lucky draw” at their station near the Suez Canal.They too perished in one of Malta's worst air disasters and their bodies were buried in the Mtarfa military cemetery.And this is just one of the many stories that will be recounted for the rest of the week during free tours of the cemetery as part of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's annual global awareness week, taking place in Malta for the first time.The event is aimed at encouraging people to discover the heritage of the world wars on their doorstep.Starting today, three dedicated volunteers – Lino Camilleri, Jean Attard and Elaine Zerafa – will tell stories about the ordinary people buried in Mtarfa who “gave their today for our tomorrow”.The commission is responsible for the commemoration of nearly 1.7 million members of the Commonwealth forces.The graves of these men and women are to be found in 153 countries and regions while the commission also takes care of nearly 4,000 non-war graves.'War Graves Week' events will be held in the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and, for the first time ever, in Malta at the Mtarfa cemetery.The cemetery can provide an endless stream of stories.Some of them date back to World War I when Malta earned the title 'Nurse of the Mediterranean', providing medical treatment to over 130,000 servicemen from the fighting in Gallipoli, Salonika and the Middle East.Years later, the island would play a different role, becoming an island fortress, besieged by German and Italian forces and becoming one of the most heavily bombed places on earth in   World War II.Many of the military personnel who died during both wars are buried at military cemeteries such as the one in Mtarfa.Located just a four-minute drive from the former Mtarfa military hospital, the cemetery is tucked away in a quiet side street and is a harmoniously peaceful place, with the silence only broken by birds chirping in the trees surrounding the graveyard.One of the first burials dates back to the 1800s.Robert Fenton was a drummer in the Lancaster regiment. He was just 16.“We think he died from an illness but it's hard to say as we have no access to medical records,” Zerafa said yesterday.Some of the headstones have visible bomb damage because the graveyard lay so close to then RAF airfield in Ta' Qali.“Aircraft would fly over Mtarfa and Mdina, strafing on the way to the airfield and this is the damage left.”Among the many others buried in Mtarfa are six members of then British prime minister Winston Churchill's delegation, who were killed in a plane crash while on the way to the historical 1945 Yalta Conference, in Crimea, on February 1, 1945.The plane circled Lampedusa for over an hour before it crashed in the sea around that tiny island and it is recorded there was some confusion about whether they were in Malta or not.Sometimes, the cemetery is at the centre of a special trip to Malta.“Every day, we meet new people and hear new stories about the people buried here,” Zerafa told Times of Malta.“Just last week, an 80-year-old woman came to visit the grave of her sister who died at just eight weeks old. We sat her down and took photos of her next to her sister's grave  and she was accompanied by her own daughter, who got to hear stories of her family and meet her aunt.”Sometimes, people come to the cemetery with picnic blankets, to sit by the side of their loved ones' tombstones, sometimes for hours.Mtarfa holds the body of one colonel, Hugh Alexander Pollock. He died in 1971.“While his headstone reads 'in loving memory of his wife Ida', Pollock was the first husband of the famous British children's author Enid Blyton. We all grew up reading her stories,” Camilleri said.The volunteers highlighted the importance of the younger generations learning and understanding the importance of the stories from Mtarfa. “These people sacrificed so much, their lives, for the freedom we get to experience today. Their stories should not be forgotten or taken for granted,” Camilleri added.Visitors are fascinated by the site“When people come here to take a peak, when our volunteers start speaking to them and telling them the stories, they end up staying for an hour or two,” Country Supervisor for Malta with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Mark Fitzgerald said.Fitzgerald was awarded an Honorary MBE for his service to the Commonwealth War Graves. While he started working for the CWGC back in 1993 as a gardener at the Pieta Military Cemetery, his connections to the Commission date back another two generations. Both his own grandfather and father worked for the CWGC, and it only felt fitting for Fitzgerald to continue their legacy. He recalled spending his childhood at the military cemetery, which he described to be his ""playground"" growing up. ""Cemeteries can be seen as a bit boring, but when people come into our site, they end up staying hours. It's amazing how interested they would be, and they would want to know more and more about the stories and Malta's history.""For more information on the 'War Graves week' tours visit: https://www.cwgc.org/our-war-graves-your-history/war-graves-week/war-graves-week-2022-event-list/  ",

It is possible not to have more cars on the road but the impact of the reduction of farmland is felt increasingly by all,"" Cacopardo said.Infrastructure Minister Aaron Farrugia said recently he is willing to discuss plans to reduce the environmental damage caused by the planned Mrieħel flyover project.The project is set to destroy one of the remaining green lungs for Qormi,  wiping out up to 20 tumoli (around 22,500 metres squared) of arable land.Moreover, a huge water reservoir will be razed to the ground while several protected olive and pomegranate trees – some hundreds of years old – will need to be uprooted.The government insists the flyover is necessary to remove the need for traffic coming from the south to have to cross the busy bypass to enter one area of the so-called business district.However, Cacopardo pointed out ""that the solution is not to make it easier for more cars to pass through but rather to reduce the number of cars on the road.""ADPD Deputy General Secretary Sandra Gauci added the ever-increasing destruction of arable land not only threatens the livelihood of farmers and their families but also undermines the provision of local produce and reduces the few remaining open spaces.It also puts at risk EU funds aimed at agriculture, these being dependent on a clear strategy in favour of this sector, she said.""If further proof was needed that the transport policy is being dictated solely by private vehicles the Mrieħel bypass project is a case in point,""  said Gauci.""Our dependency on private transport is a reflection on decades-long successive governments' lack of action in introducing measures promoting sustainable mobility,"" she added.Sandra Gauci said that the ever-increasing destruction of arable land not only threatens the livelihood of farmers and their families but also undermines the provision of local produce and reduces the few remaining open spaces. It also puts at risk EU funds aimed at agriculture, these being dependent on a clear strategy in favour of this sector.She pointed out that this is another road widening project that will lead us to nowhere because the traffic that should be moving faster along the bypass will still be getting stuck at the Qormi roundabout.""This madness should stop now,"" concluded Gauci.

https://timesofmalta.com/,Is this progress?' Mġarr farmers and residents unite to protect ODZ fields,"Mġarr residents and farmers turned up on Saturday morning to express their anger and opposition against the Electorfix group, which is appealing a planning refusal for the development of a solar farm that will take up the area of around six football pitches of agricultural land.Some 100 people met holding banners reading, “Save Mġarr”, 'Ħalluna L-Arja' (leave our air), and 'Ambjent? Fejn? (Environment? Where?).  The demonstration was led by Moviment Graffitti, which has been at the forefront of the fight against the large development. Back in March, the PA planning board unanimously rejected the proposal for a massive solar farm. The development application, filed by Joseph Schembri of Electrofix Group, proposed the construction and installation of over 5,700 photovoltaic solar panels on the rooftops of 90 greenhouses. The project received hundreds of objections. Despite the project being rejected, the applicants Schembri and Christian Paul Micallef filed an appeal to the Planning Authority to “re-assess” the application once more last month.In their appeal, they stated they have formulated new plans following 'discussions' with the energy and economy ministries, and the agriculture department.During the demonstration, Graffitti spokesperson Christine Cassar said there were two serious points of concern regarding the appeal. She said the presentation of new plans at the appeal stage is “unacceptable”, since the appeal is a legal process and is meant to cover the original plans presented to the planning board. “The appeal is a legal process during which a person or company appeals to the Tribunal against the decision of the PA, which in this case, refused the application. During the appeal, new plans cannot be presented,” she told the crowd. She said it is also unacceptable for government ministries to meet and discuss the change in plans. “Ministers should have absolutely no say in the planning process, authorities, and planning boards should operate without any form of political interference whatsoever.”She said the project runs counter to the provisions of the document that regulates solar farms in Malta - Solar Farms Policy 2021 - which clearly states they cannot be built on agricultural and natural land.Cassar also pointed out how Electrofix took up a commercial stand at the government's AgriFair this week, despite the fact the company does not operate in the farming sector. Apart from the environmental impact, the project would also impact the historical context of the temples close by, such as Ta Ħaġrat and Skorba, areas of archeological importance with a class A level of protection. Ta' Ħaġrat and Skorba form part of a group of megalithic temples constructed during the fourth and third millennium BC that are inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.According to farmers and archeologists who previously spoke to Times of Malta, the construction of the greenhouses and solar panels will prevent large volumes of water from being absorbed by the soil, with the runoff water flowing down San Pietru street and ending up in Ta' Ħaġrat temples on the other end of the village.Archeologist Francesco Fontanelli told demonstrators if the area is not protected, and the solar farms are built, there is a chance the temples will be removed from the UNESCO site. ""The amount of rain water which will end up in the site will damage the temples,"" he said. ""Is this the progress we really want and need? We always talk about moving forward and being progressive, but is this it? Is this the direction we want to go in?""He said heritage and environment are part of the country's DNA and must be protected. Mġarr mayor Paul Vella said the proposed area of development had been vacated by farmers because they were pushed out of the agricultural holdings. Just like the farmers and residents, he called for a halt to the project, which he said will leave lasting effects on the village's water resources, heritage, and residents' wellbeing.""We cannot teach our children the importance of environmental protection, with projects like this, with its visual impact, and the problems it will create to our farming community. If this project is allowed, others will follow and will ruin our country,"" Vella said.Farmers present at the demonstration explained the solar panels would be detrimental to the growth of any produce, since their installation would mean that the fields would not be exposed to direct sunlight and would instead fall in the shade.

https://timesofmalta.com/,I want to go down to the submarine where this picture was taken',"The grandson of a Royal Navy lieutenant commander has come to Malta to scuba dive down to the submarine that his beloved grandfather served on during the war. Nick Christie sailed to Malta from Scotland on his late grandfather's vintage sailing yacht, the Cruinnaeg III.Holding a black and white photo of his grandfather – Scottish George Christie – standing on the conning tower of the submarine, with the word 'Stubborn' visible beneath him, Nick says: “I wish to recreate this photo. I want to go down to the tower where this picture was taken. Where the name is. Take a picture and say: 'I was there',” he says.For this to be possible Nick has to brush up on his rusty diving skills since the wreck is at a 57-metre depth off Qawra. He has come to Malta where he will be undergoing technical diving training to prepare for the dive later this summer.Nick, 56, recounts how his grandfather was “like a father” to him.His mother, Gay, married an American man and Nick lived in Philadelphia until his parents separated when he was about seven. He then moved to Scotland, close to Glasgow, with his mother.“My grandfather became like a father figure. He taught me how to sail and so much more. He passed on his love for sailing,” he says.“I became a licensed skipper by the age of 19 and later on I helped him in the whisky business he started after the war. Ever since I was little, I always heard stories about the Stubborn.”His grandfather was second in command of HMS Stubborn after Captain Arthur Antony Duff, Nick's godfather.HMS Stubborn was an S-class submarine of the Royal Navy, launched on November 11, 1942. It spent the war in home waters, operating off the Scandinavian coast and in the Pacific Far East.On one of her missions she managed to capture a German submarine.“I remember asking my grandfather how they managed to get the German sub home since all the controls were in German. How did they convince them to surrender?“He said he removed the captain's ability to navigate by taking his timepiece and sextant (used in celestial navigation). I asked how he stopped him from running away, to which he answered: 'I removed his trousers. No self-respecting captain would be seen in his underpants'.“I thought he was joking until years later I found the trousers,” he jokes.“The Stubborn has been part of my life since forever. My grandfather kept many pieces of the Stubborn,” he chuckles.“Inside the Cruinnaeg there was a wardroom where they made the big decisions. In it, there was a plaque with the name Stubborn and a picture of a mule.  This plaque is on Cruinnaeg and it has been there since I was little.”His grandfather, who died in 2011, had bought the Cruinnaeg after the war, in 1952, as a pleasure boat. He then sold it in 1997 and Nick bought it back in 2009.Now Nick sailed to Malta aboard the Cruinnaeg in a trip that is about celebrating his grandfather. For the first time, the HMS Stubborn and the Cruinnaeg have met in the same waters.Nick set off from Scotland in November and travelled for some 2,000 miles stopping in Spain and Palma before reaching Malta where he contacted a dive school to make his dream come through. He wants to see the Stubborn that was sunk on April 30, 1946, as an ASDIC (sonar) target.The wreck is located about 5.6km north-east of St Paul's Bay and sits upright at a depth of 57 metres.Simon Sciberras, from Dive Systems, has been there and will be training Nick to do the same.“She sits on a sandy seabed slightly listed towards the port. All torpedos are still in their hatches. One hatch is open in the conning tower since it was sunk. There is a lot of growth on it and the name is covered,” he said.Nick says he is willing to do what it takes to be able to see the Stubborn, but he does not want to rush it.“This is a happy story. Everyone who served on Stubborn during the war survived and went on to live a good life. I want to keep it that way. I don't want to be the Christie that perishes on the submarine. I don't want to be the Christie who doesn't come back,” he says with a smile.He is being cautiously stubborn.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,From the bench: Counterfeits at the Freeport,"The branding of one's pro­duct or service can be defined as the words, phrases, symbols, designs or a combination of such which distin­guish and communicate the differences between one product and another.A trademark is a unique element that directs the consumer towards a specific product or service, helping one differentiate between similar products and identify the difference between them while simplifying the choice of the consumer towards what they truly desire. In most cases, an identifiable trademark also allows trust to develop between the person offering the pro­duct/service and the consumer based on the product/ service's good repute.Trademark protection is territorial in scope. The protection conferred by a Maltese trademark is limited to Malta's territorial confines; however, European trademarks also exist, and these confer protection through one unitary trademark across all European countries.The concept of unregistered trademark rights is also present under Maltese law and derive from general principles of Maltese law in the Commercial Code. In this respect, the Commercial Code provides that regardless of whether a name, mark or distinctive device has been registered as a trademark in terms of the Trademarks Act, traders may not make use of any name, mark or distinctive device capable of creating confusion with any other name, mark or distinctive device lawfully used by others.Consequently, one's primary rights to a trademark are established by use. Registering a trademark allows for greater resiliency to the mark one uses to identify his/her brand for an initial period of 10 years which may be renewed.At their core, trademark rights prevent unfair competition between traders and deceit of consumers when encountered with two or more products or services which seem identical or which may easily be associated together. Trademark rights also prevent producers of counterfeit goods from gaining an unfair advantage in trade, which may be detrimental to the repute of the 'original' distinctive EU trademark.Proprietors of EU trademarks are entitled to prevent all third parties from using, in the course of trade, signs which are identical with the EU trademark or those similar to it, in relation to goods or services which are identical to theirs. This applies in the absence of proprietors' authorisation for such towards third parties.Counterfeits, or 'dupes', are considered to be goods infringing intellectual property rights in Malta. They include goods (and their packaging) bearing a trademark that is identical to a validly registered trademark in respect of the same type of goods. Such goods are prohibited from entering Malta, as is their exportation, re-exportation, release for circulation and their placement in a free zone or free warehouse of goods.The First Hall, Civil Court and the Court of Appeal are the competent courts in Malta concerning the protection of intellectual property rights. On May 11, the First Hall, Civil Court, presided over by Mr Justice Mark Chetcuti, delivered two judgments related to this topic; bearing case number 1019/2020 concerning dupe Nike shoes and case number 990/2021 regarding the Adidas brand.In both cases involving the Adidas and the Nike trademarks, the plaintiff companies sought a court decla­ration that the pro­ducts withheld at customs were 'fakes' and thus were in breach of both local and EU law.With regard to case number 990/2021, in its judgments, the court declared that the plaintiff companies were, among others, owners of the marks known as 'three stripes device', 'three stripes device on footwear', 'trefoil device', 'adidas' and 'ADIDAS', which marks feature on seve­ral products of theirs, including shoes, sandals, flip-flops, clothing garments and caps. Such marks had been registered as EU trademarks with their own distinctive numbers.It further resulted that back in August 2021, customs officers at the Freeport in Marsaxlokk had found a total of 7,752 pairs of shoes, unloaded from the Yantian Express, which raised suspicion as to the authenticity of the products. The suspected products were indeed found to be counterfeits after having been tested.As a result of these findings, the court ordered the destruction of the products within 90 days from the date of judgment, at the expense of the shipper, and without any compensation due to the same defendant for the same destruction.Similarly, in case number 1019/2021, plaintiff Nike Innovatove CV sufficiently proved that it was the owner of Nike and other marks such as the 'Swoosh Design' used on several products by the plaintiff company and such trademarks had been registered as EU trademarks.The court found that on May 17, 2021, a total of 2,400 pairs of Nike shoe dupes had been unloaded at the Marsaxlokk Freeport, and they too were found to be counterfeits following tests conducted by a representative of the plaintiff company. As in the Adidas case, the court also ordered the destruction of the shoes within 90 days from date of judgment at the expense of the shipper, being the defendant company.Notwithstanding the demand made by the plaintiffs in both the Adidas and Nike cases, for the court to declare any further remedy in terms of law in favour of the plaintiffs, no such remedies were delved into and the court subsequently abstained from taking further cognisance of such demands in both respective judgments.Rebecca Mercieca is an associate at Azzopardi, Borg & Associates Advocates.",

https://timesofmalta.com/,English Language schools hopeful for 'positive' summer,"Following a difficult two years, English language schools are hopeful for a 'positive' summer, according to professionals in the industry.“The numbers are very encouraging, and last-minute bookings are constantly coming in, so things are looking up and are very positive,” FELTOM (Federation of English Language Teaching Organisations) CEO Caroline Tissot told Times of Malta.Following the first registered COVID-19 case back in 2020, the sector experienced thousands of cancellations, causing financial hardship for many schools and forcing some to close for good.According to official NSO data, almost 27,900 foreign students attended language schools last year, nearly 70 per cent more than 2020, yet still far from the 83,600 in 2019, the year before COVID-19.Last month, professionals raised concerns of another 'crippling' summer for the sector, due to Malta's strict COVID travel restrictions.However, these restrictions have now been lifted which means students from 'dark red' countries, such as Brazilians, who make up the majority of adult students in Malta, can now travel to the island with no major obstacles.Tissot said the sector has been in contact with Brazilian agents who are keen to reconnect with the Maltese market.“It takes time for things to fall into place once again and for bookings to accumulate, but the interest is there,” she said.Her comments were echoed by the CEO of EC Malta, a major English language school with operations in several countries.“We will do better this summer, but we must remain realistic, such changes take time to trickle down to agencies and markets in places like Brazil,” Andrew Mangion said.“We must also keep in mind since it is so close to summer, airline prices have increased substantially, and this is also brought about by the rise in inflation. So, while our Brazilian agents are glad the market is open once again, it is a little too late to book for summer.”Both Mangion and Tissot note a positive trend in bookings for juniors, mainly coming from the European market.Mangion noted from his own school there is a demand from France, Germany, and Scandinavia, but less interest from Italy.“We believe this is partially due to last summer's disastrous closure of the market, and we feel that our Italian agents have not forgotten what was done to our industry last summer,” he said.After reopening last July following a second lockdown, foreign students were found to be partly behind a spike in COVID cases, which led to schools having to close their doors yet again.“We are looking forward to this summer, but recovery for the industry will take time.”The industry has also been affected by the war in Ukraine.“Before the war, the Ukraine market was just beginning to emerge, but of course now the situation is very different,” Tissot said.“Now we are doing all that we can to help Ukrainian refugees in Malta, by providing beginners classes to those who need help to learn the language and settle in the country.”Prior to the pandemic, the Russian market was also very strong, and in 2019 approximately 6,000 students studied in Malta. However, in 2020 this figure was reduced to 570 Russians.“Now with the current sanctions in place, the market cannot be tapped into, but despite these challenges, summer is still looking positive,” she said.Asked if the pandemic also left an impact on teaching staff, both confirmed the number of teachers available was down during the past two years.“The pandemic did leave a lasting effect, with some people deciding to leave the industry and not come back,” she said.Mangion said other countries, such as Canada and the US, are also facing a dip in ELT teachers.Both shared a sense of optimism that the numbers will bounce back, praising teaching as a rewarding and fun career.When it came to host families, Mangion said there are groups of people who are ready to move forward from a 'pandemic to endemic' and others who are still very cautious and need time before they welcome strangers into their house.“It will take time, but the number of host families will climb back,” he said.“It's both a way of meeting new people, but also with the global rise in inflation, hosting is also another way to make some additional income, which many people will start looking into.”So, with summer just weeks away, what is the industry expecting?“We have had a lot of support from the government, health authorities and stakeholders, and are ready to move forward,” Tissot said.Mangion said when he speaks to his staff, he can sense a feeling of 'hopefulness'.“We must truly learn from our mistakes, and last summer was a very big mistake. As an industry that wants to move forward, we cannot re-open, then close and then re-open again, it is not sustainable for any industry, let alone ours.”",

Grech said that the party was facing difficult times and this was when the mettle of both the PN and the individuals who hold it up is tested.“We are being asked to decide what road lies ahead in these trying times,” he said in an interview on party media. “I have no doubt in my mind that the only direction for the Nationalist Party is to move forward. This means there needs to be courageous restructuring that has never been done before.” “This is the message that the electorate has sent us,” he continued. “We must not only change our rhetoric, but the dynamic of how we work together and with others must be transformed. Change must come immediately and with care and skill.” 1,600 party councillors are eligible to vote in the leadership contest, with voting starting on Monday. While a simple majority of 50 per cent plus one would reconfirm Grech as leader, he has admitted that anything less than 70 per cent of the vote would be “disappointing”. However, PN sources who spoke to Times of Malta said that “apathy” and disillusionment is rife among a number of councillors in whose hands Grech's future as leader lies. Grech said that the party's finances were also a pressing issue currently faced by the PN. Last month Grech revealed the party including its companies were some €32 million in debt and causing a cashflow crisis of €2 million annually, with financial advisers being roped in to draw up a plan to resolve the crisis. “This is the largest challenge the Nationalist Party is facing at the moment, but I am confident that we can conquer this challenge together,” he said. He stressed that the time of tough decisions was at hand and recurring problems could not continue to be swept under the rug, shackling the party from moving forward. “On the other hand, we cannot give up because we still represent almost half the electorate of this country.” Party operations also needed to be urgently organised, Grech went on to say. “After a process that saw the regeneration of several internal roles, the last election gave use a parliamentary group through the democratic choice of the people,” he said. “Now it's time for a structure that befits a modern and effective party and that ensures discipline among all party members.”",
https://timesofmalta.com/,"Most COVID-19 measures at Mater Dei Hospital lifted, but masks to stay","Mater Dei Hospital visiting hours will revert back to normal from Monday for the first time since the pandemic hit in 2020.This means that as from Monday, patients will be allowed visitors between 11.30am to 1pm and between 3pm and 8pm.Despite the visiting hours finally reverting to pre-pandemic times, the hospital will continue to enforce rules on the number of visitors allowed by a patient. According to a health ministry spokesperson, only one visitor per patient will be allowed ""in order to reduce the footfall inside the hospital"".The ministry did not say whether this rule will be lifted anytime soon. Before COVID-19, patients were allowed between two and three patients at one go, although that rule had been loosely followed and patients would often be allowed to have more by their side.The ministry spokesperson also confirmed patients under 70 will once again be allowed to have someone accompany them at emergency and the outpatients department. In the past two years, only the elderly over the age of 70 and people requiring special assistance were allowed to have someone with them. All other patients had to wait as well as receive any treatment by themselves.As already announced by the health authorities, mask-wearing in hospital settings will continue to be enforced, and anyone visiting the hospital must don a mask.The spokesperson did not say whether this rule will be dropped in the future.When the pandemic hit in March 2020, Mater Dei was the first to introduce strict measures in an attempt to control the spread of COVID-19. Within days of the first few cases being detected, the hospital descaled its normal operations and postponed all non-urgent surgeries.Patients had also been urged to not visit the hospital unless absolutely necessary.By April that year, all visits to the hospital had been stopped. These resumed a few weeks later but were reduced in order to avoid too many people on wards. ",
